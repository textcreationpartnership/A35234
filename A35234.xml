            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AN Ingenious Hiſtorian who was a great Traveller, writing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this famous City about Thirty years ſince, ventured to compare it as to Scituation, Government, Trade, Artiſts, and all other Accommodations to the greateſt Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> yea all things conſidered, to the Greatest in the World, and if at that time it deſerved ſuch high <hi>Encomiums,</hi> then certainly ſince its Riſe out of thoſe Ruines that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily befell a great part thereof by the dreadful fire in <hi>1666,</hi> it doth even excel it ſelf; and the Beauty thereof is very much increaſed, eſpecially as to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Curioſity of Buildings, largeneſs of Streets, and many other Excellencies which that fiery Purgation hath occaſioned; So that we may invert what was formerly ſaid of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time, <hi>That the Glory of the former City is
<pb facs="tcp:56661:3"/>not to be compared with the Glory of the latter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There needs then no Apology for making this ſhort Collection concerning this great Subject, eſpecially ſince there are few Books now extant that Treat of the Antiquities thereof, and none that I know of, who have written of the particular Accidents that happened thereunto; It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be unacceptable to have a ſhort Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual of ſo many particulars, for ſo long time paſt at ſo ſmall a price as this is, The ſerious peruſal whereof will very much confirm the Truth of what the wiſe <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> writ ſo long ſince, Eccl. <hi>1.9. The thing that hath been, it is that which ſhall be, and that which is done is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the Sun.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The Original and Foundation of the Famous City of</hi> London.</head>
                  <p>THough it may ſeem difficult to diſcover the Original of ſome Nations and Cities, yet it is no hard matter to find out the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Honourable and Famous City of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers to magnify the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> drew its Original from Gods, and Demy-Gods, by the race of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> ſo <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> our <hi>Welſh</hi> Hiſtorian, for the greater Glory of this Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed City, deduceth it from the ſame Original, relating that <hi>Bruce</hi> who deſcended from the Demy-God <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Venus,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> about the year of the World 2855, and 1108 years before the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our bleſſed Saviour built this City near the River now called <hi>Thames,</hi> and named it <hi>Troynovant,</hi> or <hi>Trenovant;</hi> but this Account has no great Authority.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56661:4"/>
                  <p>The ſame Hiſtorian tells us, that K. <hi>Lud</hi> afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired and increaſed this City with fair Buildings, Towers, and Walls, and called it after his own name <hi>Caire Lud</hi> or <hi>Luds</hi> Town, and the Gate which he built in the Weſt part thereof, he likewiſe for his own Honour named <hi>Ludgate.</hi> He adds, That this <hi>Lud</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Androgeus</hi> and <hi>Theomantius,</hi> who being not of Age to Govern at the Death of their Father, their Uncle <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> took upon him the Crown; in the eight year of whoſe Reign, <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> arrived in <hi>England</hi> with a formidable Army to Conquer it, and obliged the <hi>Brittains</hi> to pay a yearly Tribute to <hi>Rome. Caeſar</hi> calls <hi>London</hi> the City of the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> which ſounds ſomewhat like <hi>Troy Nova,</hi> though learned men think that <hi>Trinobantes</hi> ſignifies the State or Signiory of the <hi>Trinobantes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in thoſe dayes, the Cities of the <hi>Brittains</hi> were not artificially built with Stone or Timber, but were only thick, and Troubleſome Woods plaſhed together, and intrenched round, like to thoſe which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> at this day call <hi>Faſtneſſes;</hi> Some are of Opinion that whence <hi>London</hi> had her Fame, from thence ſhe had alſo a Name, that is from Ships, which the <hi>Brittains</hi> call <hi>Lough,</hi> and <hi>Dinan</hi> a Town, ſo that <hi>London</hi> is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Shipton,</hi> a Town of Ships; which Title no City hath more Right to aſſume than this, being ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon the gentle Aſcent of an Hill, near a gallant Navigable River, which ſwelling at certain times with the Ocean Tides, ſhe is able by her deep and ſafe Channel to entertain the greateſt Ships, which bring in all the richeſt Commodities the World can afford.</p>
                  <p>Some would have <hi>Llwndian</hi> the <hi>Welſh</hi> name of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to be derived from <hi>Llhwn</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>fenced Town,</hi> made of Trees caſt down and barricadoed together, as aforementioned, for ſo the Poet ſings.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56661:4"/>
                  <q>
                     <l>— Their Houſes were the Thicks,</l>
                     <l>And buſhy queachy hollow Caves</l>
                     <l>And Hurdles made of Sticks.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And it is probable, that in the Place where St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church now ſtands, there was a Wood or Grove, and a Temple dedicated to <hi>Diana,</hi> which was uſually ſet up in the Woods; and in a place about St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> there were the Heads and Bones of Oxen lately found, which is ſuppoſed were offered in Sacrifice to her.</p>
                  <p>Now though it be not certainly known, who was the Founder of <hi>London,</hi> yet whoever it was, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much Prudence in the Choice of Scituation; for ſhe ſeems to have been built in an happy hour, having continued for ſo many Ages; <hi>Amianus Marcellinus</hi> who wrote near thirteen hundred years ago, calls her then, an <hi>Ancient City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> had reduced the hither parts of <hi>Brittain</hi> into the form of a Province, and had ſown the ſeeds of Civility here, as well as over all <hi>Europe,</hi> this City began to be renowned and famous for Wealth, Riches, and Proſperity, yea ſhe continued always the ſame under the <hi>Romans, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> being ſeldom or never afflicted with any great Calamities. In the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> when the <hi>Brittains</hi> had conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to recover their loſt Liberty, under the Conduct of <hi>Boadicia,</hi> the <hi>Londoners</hi> could not with all their weeping and Lamentations, keep <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> in the City, but after he had raiſed a Power of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, he would needs go from thence, leaving the City naked to the Enemy, who preſently ſurprized it, and ſlew thoſe whom either weakneſs, feebleneſs, or ſweetneſs of the place, had detained there. Nor was <hi>London</hi> in leſs danger by the <hi>Gaules</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> if ſhe had not been wonderfully preſerved, for when <hi>Caius Alectus,</hi> had Treacherouſly deſtroyed <hi>Carauſius,</hi> he kept to himſelf the Revenues of <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:56661:5"/>and called himſelf <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Emperour, as his Coins often found here do demonſtrate; But when <hi>Marcus Aſclepiodotus</hi> had ſlain him in Battel, thoſe <hi>French</hi> who remained alive after the Fight, haſtening to <hi>London,</hi> would have plundred the City, had not the River <hi>Thames,</hi> (who never fail'd to help the <hi>Londoners</hi> at need) very happily brought the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions to their Aſſiſtance, who put the <hi>Barbarians</hi> to the Sword all the City over. About which time it is Recorded, that <hi>Lucius Gallus</hi> was ſlain by a Brookſide which ran almoſt through the City, and of him was called by the <hi>Brittains, Wantgall,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh, Walbrook,</hi> which name remains to this day, under which there is a Sewer within the ground, to carry the Kennel water of the City into the <hi>Thames.</hi> This is not far from <hi>London-ſtone,</hi> which is thought to be a <hi>Milemark,</hi> or <hi>Miliary,</hi> ſuch as were in the Market Places of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which were taken dimenſions of Journeys every way, which ſeems the more probable, becauſe this Stone is near the midſt of the City as it lyeth in length.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Julius Agricola</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Lieutenant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the <hi>Brittains</hi> to build Houſes for themſelves, and Temples for their Gods, to bring up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Learning, and to Apparel themſelves like <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> ſo that in a few years after our Saviours Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſhe became famous, but eſpecially for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Merchants, Proviſion and Trade thereof, as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> notes, and was then called by ſome Authors <hi>Londinum,</hi> by others <hi>Auguſta,</hi> under which name her Fame is celebrated by an Ancient Author, which is thus Tranſlated by <hi>Philemon Holland;</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>The Ancient, and preſent Walls and Gates of the City.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>HIſtorians report, That about the year after Chriſt 306, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, at the deſire of his Mother <hi>Helena,</hi> did firſt build a Wall about this City, which may ſeem more probable, conſidering that the <hi>Brittains</hi> did underſtand how to build Walls with Stone, as may appear by the following Relation.</p>
                  <p>About the Year of Chriſt 399, when the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> was invaded, and that City deſtroyed by the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> called away all their Forces from <hi>Brittain</hi> for the Defence of their own Countrey; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the <hi>Brittains</hi> being not able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were for many years oppreſſed by two cruel Nations, that is, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> whereupon they ſent Ambaſſadors, with Letters full of Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Supplications and Complaints to <hi>Rome,</hi> to deſire their aſſiſtance, promiſing conſtant Obedience to them. The <hi>Romans</hi> ſent them a Legion of Souldiers, who fought with their Enemies and drove them out of the Countrey; And leaving the <hi>Brittains</hi> at Liberty they adviſed them to make a Wall croſs the Countrey from one Sea to the other, for their defence againſt their troubleſome Neighbours; and then the <hi>Romans</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home in Triumph.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Brittains</hi> built this Wall in the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but wanting Maſons, they did not make it of Stone as the <hi>Romans</hi> directed, but of Turf, which was ſo weak, that it was little Security to them. For their Enemies perceiving the <hi>Romans</hi> were gone, they preſently came in Boats, and invaded their Countrey, ruining and waſting all before them. Upon which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56661:6"/>Ambaſſadors were again ſent with freſh Lamentations to <hi>Rome,</hi> beſeeching them not to ſuffer their miſerable Countrey to be wholy deſtroyed; The <hi>Romans</hi> then ſent them another Legion, who coming ſuddenly, ſurprized their Enemies and made a great ſlaughter among them, chaſing them back again even to their own Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> departing home again, told the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> plainly, that the Journey hither was long and troubleſome, and therefore they muſt expect no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help from them; but muſt learn to uſe Armour, and weapons themſelves, thereby to be able to reſiſt their Enemies, who were incouraged to invade them becauſe of their Cowardice and Faintheartedneſs; However for the incouragement of their Tributary Friends, whom they were now forced to forſake the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> made them a Wall of hard Stone from the Weſt Sea to the Eaſt Sea, and built two Cities at each end thereof, the <hi>Brittains</hi> labouring therein alſo. This Wall was built Eight Foot thick, and twelve Foot high, directly Eaſt and Weſt, as appears by the ruins to be ſeen at this day. The work being finiſhed; the <hi>Romans</hi> gave them a ſtrict charge to look to themſelves, and to inſtruct their People in the uſe of Arms, and Millitary Diſcipline, and leaſt the Enemy ſhould come by Sea, Southward, they made divers Bulwarks at ſome diſtance from each other by the Seaſide; And then bid the <hi>Brittains</hi> farewel, as intending to return no more; This happened in the Reign of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger; near 500 years after the firſt Arrival of the <hi>Romans</hi> here, and about the year of our Lord 434.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Brittains</hi> after this had ſeveral Skirmiſhes with the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and made Choice of <hi>Vortiger</hi> to be their King and Leader, who is ſaid to have been nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wiſe nor Valiant, being wholly given up to Luſt and Debauchery; And the People likewiſe having ſome reſt from their Enemies, ran into Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56661:7"/>Drunkenneſs, Pride, Contention, Envy, and all manner of Vice, to the great ſcandal of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Profeſſion. At which time a dreadful Peſtilence fell upon them, which deſtroyed ſuch a multitude of them, that the quick were not ſufficient to bury the dead, and yet thoſe that remained alive continued ſo impenitent, that neither the death of their Friends, nor fear of their Enemies had any Effect upon them, whereupon Divine Juſtice purſued them even almoſt to the Deſtruction of the whole ſinful Nation</p>
                  <p>For being now again in danger of utter ruin from their old Neighbours the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with their King <hi>Vortiger</hi> what to do, and at laſt conclude to call in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who ſoon after arrived in <hi>Brittain;</hi> where (ſaith <hi>Bede</hi>) they were received as Friends, For having driven out the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> they likewiſe drove out the <hi>Brittains,</hi> forcing ſome of them to fly over the Seas, and others into the barren and waſte Mountains of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> were likewiſe ignorant of building with Stone till the year 680. for it is affirmed that <hi>Bennet</hi> Abbot of <hi>Werral,</hi> and Maſter to Reverend <hi>Bede,</hi> firſt brought in Artificers for Stone houſes, and Glaſs Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, unknown before to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who built only with Wood. And to this <hi>Polychronicon</hi> agrees; who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe times, ſaith, <hi>Then had ye wooden Churches, nay wooden Chalices, but Golden Priests; but now you have Golden Chalices, and Wooden Prieſts.</hi> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Argument, King <hi>Edgar</hi> in his Charter to the Abby of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> dated the year of Chriſt 974, writes to this Effect; <hi>All the Monaſteries in my Realm to the outward ſight are nothing but wormeaten and rotten Timber, and Boards, and which is worſe, within they are almost empty, and void of Divine Worſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much as to Walls in General, now to return to <hi>London;</hi> This City was deſtroyed and burnt by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and other Pagan Enemies, about the year of our Lord 839, and was nobly rebuilt, and repaired in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56661:7"/>the year 886 by <hi>Alfred</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> ſo that it lay waſte, and uninhabited for almoſt fifty years; <hi>Alfred</hi> committed the cuſtody of this new built City to his Son in Law <hi>Etheldred</hi> Earl of <hi>Mercia,</hi> to whom he had before married his Daughter <hi>Ethelsted;</hi> And that this City was then ſtrongly Walled may appear by divers Accidents; <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> writes, that about the year 994 the <hi>Londoners</hi> ſhut up their Gates and defended their King <hi>Etheldred</hi> within their Walls againſt the <hi>Danes.</hi> In the year 1016, <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> made War againſt <hi>Edmond Ironſide,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and brought his Navy to the Weſt part of the Bridge, caſting a Trench about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and attempted to have won it by aſſault, but the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens repulſed him, and drove him from their Walls. Likewiſe in the year 1052, Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> with his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Sailed up by the South end of the Bridge, and aſſailed the Walls of this City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Fitz Stephen</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 2. writes thus, <hi>The Wall of</hi> London <hi>is High and Great, well To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered on the North ſide, with due distance between the Towers. On the South ſide alſo the City was Walled and Towered, but the Fiſhful River of</hi> Thames <hi>by his ebbing and flowing hath long ſince ſubverted them.</hi> Where by the Northſide he means from the River in the Eaſt to the River of <hi>Thames</hi> in the Weſt, for ſo the Wall ſtretched in his time, and the City being far longer from Eaſt to Weſt, than in breadth from South to North, and alſo narrower at both ends than in the midſt, is therefore compaſſed with the Wall on the Landſide in the form of a Bow, except where it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented in betwixt <hi>Cripplegate</hi> and <hi>Alderſgate.</hi> But the Wall on the Southſide along the River of <hi>Thames</hi> was ſtreight as the ſtring of a Bow and fortified with Towers or Bulwarks (as we now term them) in due diſtance from each other, as our Author ſays, and we our ſelves may obſerve at this day, this demonſtrates that the Walls of this City are of great Antiquity.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56661:8"/>
                  <p>Now for repairing and maintaining this Wall, we find, That in the year 1215 and the 6th of King <hi>John.</hi> The Barons entring the City by <hi>Aldgate,</hi> firſt took Aſſurance of the City, and then broke into the <hi>Jews</hi> houſes, and ſeizing their Money and Goods for their own uſes, they with great diligence repaired the Walls, and Gates of this City, with Stones taken from the <hi>Jews</hi> broken Houſes. In the year 1257, <hi>Henry</hi> 3. ordered the Walls of this City which were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and without Towers to be handſomely repaired, and beautified at the common Charge of the City.</p>
                  <p>In the 17th of <hi>Edward</hi> 4. <hi>Ralph Joceline</hi> Mayor cauſed part of the Wall of the City of <hi>London</hi> to be repaired between <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and <hi>Alderſgate;</hi> He alſo cauſed <hi>Morefields</hi> to be ſearched for Clay to make brick for that purpoſe. The <hi>Skinners</hi> made that part of the Wall between <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and <hi>Buvies Marks,</hi> (commonly call'd <hi>Bevis Marks</hi>) toward <hi>Biſhopſgate,</hi> as may appear by their Arms fixed in three places there; The Lord Mayor, and his Company of <hi>Drapers</hi> made all that part between <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> and <hi>Alhallows</hi> Church in the Wall, and from <hi>Alhallows</hi> toward the <hi>Poſtern</hi> called <hi>Moregate.</hi> A great part of the ſame Wall was repaired by the Executors of Sir <hi>John Crosby</hi> Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, his Arms being in 2 places; and other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies repaired the reſt of the Wall to <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> the Goldſmiths repaired from <hi>Cripplegate</hi> to <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> and there the work ceaſed.</p>
                  <p>The Circuit of the VVall of <hi>London</hi> on the Lands ſide, that is from the Tower of <hi>London</hi> in the Eaſt to <hi>Aldgate</hi> is 82 Perches; From <hi>Aldgate</hi> to <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> 86 Perchees; From <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> to <hi>Cripplegate</hi> 162 Perches; From <hi>Cripplegate</hi> to <hi>Alderſgate</hi> 75 Perches; From <hi>Alderſgate</hi> to <hi>Newgate</hi> 66 Perches; From <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> to <hi>Ludgate</hi> 42 Perches; in all 513 Perches of Aſſize. From <hi>Ludgate</hi> to <hi>Fleet</hi> Ditch 60 Perches; From <hi>Fleetbridge</hi> to the River of <hi>Thames</hi> about 70 Perches. So that the total of theſe Perches amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56661:8"/>to 643; and every Perch being 5 Yards and an half, makes 3536 Yards and an half, containing 10608 Foot, which is two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles and 608 Foot more.</p>
                  <p>In former time there were but four Gates in the VVall of this City, that is <hi>Aldgate</hi> for the Eaſt; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſgate</hi> for the North; <hi>Ludgate</hi> for the VVeſt; and <hi>Bridgate</hi> over <hi>London Bridge</hi> for the South, but of late days for the Conveniency of Paſſengers, divers other Gates and Poſterns have been made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fitz Stephen</hi> ſaith, that in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 2 there were ſeven Double Gates in the VVall of this City, but names them not, we may therefore ſuppoſe them to be, 1. The Gate next the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> called the <hi>Postern.</hi> 2. <hi>Aldgate.</hi> 3. <hi>Biſhopſgate.</hi> 4. <hi>Alderſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi> 5. <hi>Newgate.</hi> 6. <hi>Ludgate.</hi> 7. <hi>Bridge-gate.</hi> Since which there hath been built <hi>Moregate,</hi> now a Famous Gate and ſeveral other ſmaller Poſterns, as one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Biſhopſgate</hi> and <hi>Moregate,</hi> and two between <hi>Moregate</hi> and <hi>Cripplegate;</hi> beſides other in other Places.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt called the <hi>Poſtern</hi> near the Tower (which was deſtroyed by the dreadful Fire in 1666 of which you have a particular Account in this Treatiſe and never ſince rebuilt or like to be) by that which remained of it before, it ſeemed to have been a fair ſtrong Arched Gate, built of hard Stone. In the year 1190, and the 2. of <hi>Richard</hi> 1. <hi>William Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamp,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> Chancellor, cauſed part of the City VVall from that Gate to the <hi>White Tower</hi> to be broken down, for inlarging the <hi>Tower,</hi> round which he made a VVall imbattelled, which is now the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt VVall; He likewiſe made a broad deep Ditch without the VVall, to let in the Tyde from the <hi>Thames;</hi> But the Southſide of this Gate was by undermining the Foundation much weakned, and about two Hundred years after, that is 1440, the 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. it fell down, and was never ſince rebuilt.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56661:9"/>
                  <p>The next in the Eaſt, is <hi>ALDGATE,</hi> or <hi>Oldgate</hi> of the Antiquity thereof, having been one of the four Principal Gates, and alſo one of the ſeven Double Gates aforementioned; It had two pair of Gates and Portculliſes, though now but one; yet the hooks of the other Gate, and the place of letting down the other Portcullice are yet to be ſeen. This Gate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be very Ancient, being named in a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in King <hi>Edgars</hi> time; and likewiſe in K. <hi>Edward</hi> 1. And in the Civil VVars between K. <hi>John,</hi> and his Barons 1215. the <hi>Londoners</hi> were on the Barons part, who then beſieged <hi>Northampton,</hi> and after came to <hi>Bedford</hi> Caſtle, where they were well received by <hi>William Beauchamp</hi> Captain thereof; and having then ſecret Notice, that if they pleaſed they might enter the City, they removed their Camp to <hi>Ware,</hi> and from thence coming to <hi>London</hi> in the Night, they entred by <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and placing Guards at the Gates, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all things at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>They ſpoiled the Fryers Houſes, and ſearcht their Coffers; after which <hi>Robert Fitzwater, Jeffery Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> cheif Commander in the Army applied themſelves to repair the Gates and VValls of the City, with ſtones taken from the <hi>Jews</hi> Houſes as aforeſaid; and <hi>Aldgate</hi> being moſt ruinous, and having given them an eaſie entrance, they repaired, or rather new built it, after the manner of the <hi>Normans,</hi> with ſtrong Arches, and Bulwarks of Stone, ſmall brick, and <hi>Flanders</hi> Tile.</p>
                  <p>In the 11 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 1471, <hi>Thomas</hi> Baſtard <hi>Faucon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> having Aſſembled a Riotous Company of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> came with a great Navy of Ships up to the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the L. Mayor and Aldermen with conſent of the Common Council fortified the <hi>Thames</hi> ſides with Armed Men, Guns, and other warlike weapons, from <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to prevent their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But the Rebels being denied paſſage that way,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56661:9"/>they fell upon <hi>Aldgate, Biſhopſgate, Cripplegate, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſgate, London Bridge,</hi> and along the Bankſide, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arrows, and Guns into the City, and burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove threeſcore houſes in the Suburbs.</p>
                  <p>And upon Sunday <hi>May</hi> 11, 1471. Five thouſand of them aſſaulting <hi>Aldgate,</hi> won the Bulwarks, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the City, but the Portcullice being let down, thoſe that were in were ſlain? And <hi>Robert Baſſet</hi> Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of that Ward, commanded them in the name of God to draw up the Portcullice, which being done, the <hi>Londoners</hi> iſſued out of the Gate, and couragiouſly beat back their Enemies to St. <hi>Buttolphs</hi> Church, by which time, the Earl <hi>Rivers</hi> and the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> coming with freſh Forces, joined them, and then they ſoon routed the Rebels, and made them fly, Alderman <hi>Baſſet</hi> and other Citizens chaſing them to <hi>Miland,</hi> and from thence, purſued ſome of them to <hi>Poplar,</hi> and others to <hi>Stratford,</hi> killing many, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers Priſoners. In the mean time, <hi>Fauconbridge</hi> their Commander, having in vain aſſaulted other Places on the Waterſide, fled to his Ships. Thus much of <hi>Aldgate</hi> as it was of old, we ſhall ſpeak of the rebuilding when we come to <hi>Aldgate</hi> Ward.</p>
                  <p>The third Gate toward the North, is <hi>BISHOPS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATE;</hi> ſuppoſed to be built by ſome Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> though now unknown; But the occaſion thereof was for the eaſe of Paſſengers, eſpecially to <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgſhire,</hi> &amp;c. who before were forced to go much about; yet it is ſomewhat Ancient, for we read that in the year 1210, ſome Land was ſold to the Procurators or Wardens of <hi>London Bridge,</hi> ſituate in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Buttolph</hi> without <hi>Biſhopſgate.</hi> And in a Charter dated 1235. It is writt, <hi>That</hi> Walter Brume <hi>and</hi> Roſia <hi>his Wife, having founded the</hi> Priory, <hi>or</hi> New Hoſpital <hi>of our</hi> Bleſſed Lady, (<hi>ſince called St.</hi> Mary Spittle (<hi>without</hi> Biſhopſgate, <hi>have confirmed the ſame to the Honour of God, and our</hi> Bleſſed Lady <hi>for</hi> Canons Regular. Alſo in 1247, <hi>Simeon Fitz Mary,</hi> Sheriff of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56661:10"/>
                     <hi>London,</hi> the 29 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. founded the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary</hi> called <hi>Bethlem</hi> without <hi>Biſhopſgate:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for repairing this Gate, <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. confirmed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Liberties to the Merchants of the <hi>Haunce</hi> to keep it in repair, which they did for many years; But in the year 1551, having prepared Stone and a new Gate to be ſet up, at the Complaint of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants their Charter was taken from them, ſo that the Old Gate remained.</p>
                  <p>Next to this upon the Northſide of the City, is <hi>MOREGATE;</hi> of which we read, that in the 3d of <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. 1415, <hi>Thomas Faulconer</hi> Mayor, cauſed the VVall of the City to be broken through near <hi>Coleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> and there builded a <hi>Poſtern,</hi> now called <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> of a Moory ground hard by, which is now drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made fair and firm, and turned into ſeveral Feilds and delightful VValks, with Trees ſet in curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Order for the Accommodation of the Citizens; This Gate ſince the dreadful Fire of <hi>London</hi> in 1666 has been new built and is made very Noble with a great Arch and two Poſterns, ſo that it now equals, if not excels any other Gate of the City.</p>
                  <p>Between this Gate and <hi>Cripplegate</hi> there have been lately made two Poſterns through the VVall, for the better eaſe of Paſſengers, and ſeveral new Houſes built near them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CRIPPLEGATE</hi> is next, which is of great Antiquity being ſo called before the Conqueſt, for we read that in 1010, the <hi>Danes</hi> ſpoiling the Kingdom of the <hi>East-Angles, Alwyn</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Helinham,</hi> cauſed the body of King <hi>Edmund</hi> the Martyr to be brought from <hi>Brediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> (now called St. <hi>Edmunds Bury</hi>) through the Kingdom of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> and ſo to <hi>London</hi> in at <hi>Cripplegate.</hi> Some ſay it was ſo named from <hi>Cripples</hi> begging there, and that when the body of St. <hi>Edmund</hi> paſſed through it, many Miracles were wrought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as that ſome of the Lame were cured, praiſing God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Body continued three years in St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56661:10"/>Church</hi> near St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> And further, <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> in his Charter for Confirming the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Colledge in <hi>London,</hi> called St. <hi>Martins le Grand,</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>I do give and grant to the ſame Church, and Canons ſerving God therein, all the Lands, and the Moor without the Poſtern which is called</hi> Cripplegate, <hi>on either part of the Poſtern.</hi> VVe read likewiſe, That <hi>Alfune</hi> builded the Pariſh Church of St. <hi>Giles</hi> nigh a Gate of the City called <hi>Porta Contractorum</hi> or <hi>Crippleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> about the year 1090.</p>
                  <p>This Gate was formerly a Priſon for Citizens for Debt or otherwiſe, like one of the Counters; It was new built in 1244 by the Brewers of <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Shaw</hi> Goldſmith in 1483. gave by his VVill 400 Marks, and the ſtuff of the the old Gate called <hi>Cripple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> to build the ſame again, which was accordingly done in 1491.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ALDERSGATE</hi> or <hi>Aelderſgate</hi> is next, not ſo called from <hi>Aldwich,</hi> or of <hi>Elders,</hi> or Ancient men building the ſame, nor of Elder Trees growing more plentifully there than in other places, as ſome have fancied; but only from the Antiquity thereof, it being one of the four firſt Gates of this City, ſerving for the Northern, as <hi>Aldgate</hi> doth for the Eaſtern Parts, and being both Old Gates, for diſtinction, one is called <hi>Alderſgate,</hi> and the other <hi>Aldgate;</hi> This Gate hath had ſeveral Additional buildings to it, as on the Southſide, where ſeveral large Rooms and Lodgings of Timber have been made; And on the Eaſtſide a Great Timber building with one large Room paved with Stone or Tile) there is likewiſe a well curbed with Stone, and of a great depth, which riſes into that Room though two Stories high from the Ground, which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; <hi>John Day</hi> a famous Printer, dwelt in this Gate, and built many Houſes upon the City wall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward St. <hi>Anns Church.</hi> You may read more of the new building this Gate in <hi>Alderſgate</hi> Ward.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:56661:11"/>
                  <p>In the ſixth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Three was a <hi>Poſtern Gate</hi> made through the City VVall on the Northſide of the late diſſolved Cloiſter of <hi>Friars Minors,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Gray Friars;</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt Church,</hi> and <hi>Hoſpital;</hi> this was done to make a Paſſage from <hi>Chriſt Church</hi> Hoſpital, to St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Hoſpital in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and Licenſe was given to Sir <hi>Richard Dobbs,</hi> Lord Mayor to do it, by Virtue of an Act of Common Council, <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. in the 6 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>The next Gate is on the Northweſt, and is called <hi>NEWGATE,</hi> and is the fifth Principal Gate, though built later than the reſt, being erected about the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. or K. <hi>Stephen</hi> upon this occaſion. The Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> being burnt down in the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour 1086. <hi>Mauritius</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> did not repair the Old Church as ſome have thought, but laid the Foundation of a new one, which it was judged would hardly ever have been finiſhed, it was ſo wonderful for length, bredth, and height; and likewiſe becauſe it was raiſed upon Vaults or Arches, after the <hi>Norman</hi> faſhion, and never known in <hi>England</hi> before.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Mauritius, Richard Beumore</hi> did very much advance the building of this Church purchaſing the large Streets and Lanes round about, which ground he incompaſſed with a ſtrong Stone VVall and Gates: By reaſon of this incloſure for ſo large a Church-yard, the High-ſtreet from <hi>Aldgate</hi> in the Eaſt, to <hi>Ludgate</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> was made ſo ſtreight and narrow, that the Carriage through the City was by <hi>Paternoſter-Row,</hi> down <hi>Ave-Mary</hi> Lane, and ſo through <hi>Bouger Row</hi> (now called <hi>Ludgateſtreet</hi>) to <hi>Ludgate;</hi> or elſe by <hi>Cheapſide</hi> through <hi>Watlingstreet,</hi> and ſo through <hi>Carter-lane,</hi> and up <hi>Creed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> which Paſſage by reaſon of the often turning was very Inconvenient.</p>
                  <p>VVhereupon a New Gate was made to paſs through <hi>Cheapſide</hi> (North of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>) St. <hi>Nicholas Shambles,</hi> and <hi>Newgate-ſtreet</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and from thence weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56661:11"/>to <hi>Holbourn Bridge;</hi> or Turning without the Gate, to <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and <hi>Iſlington,</hi> (or <hi>Iſeldon</hi>) or to any place North, or VVeſt. This Gate hath for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years been a Priſon for Felons, Murderers, High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waymen and other Treſpaſſers, as appeareth by the Records of King <hi>John</hi> and others; and among the reſt in the 3. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. 1218. That King writ to the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> commanding them to repair the Goal of <hi>Newgate,</hi> for the ſafe keeping of his Priſoners, promiſing that the Charges thereof ſhould be allowed them upon their Account in the Exchequer.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1241. The <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being accuſed for Circumciſing a Chriſtian Child; their Houſe (called the <hi>Thor</hi>) was pulled down and deſtroyed; <hi>Aaron</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> were conſtrained to pay twenty thouſand Marks, at two Terms in the year, or elſe to be kept perpetual Priſoners in <hi>Newgate</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and in other Priſons.</p>
                  <p>In 1255, King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. lodged in the Tower, and upon ſome diſpleaſure againſt the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the eſcape of <hi>John Offrem</hi> a Clerk Convict, Priſoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> for killing a Prior who was Couſin to the Queen, He ſent for the Lord Mayor, who laid the fault on the Sheriffs to whoſe Cuſtody the Priſoners are committed; the Mayor was diſcharged, but the Sheriffs were impriſoned above a month, though they alledged the fault was in the Biſhops Officers, who though he was impriſoned in <hi>Newgate,</hi> yet they were to ſee that he was kept ſafe. But however the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired three thouſand Marks of the City for a Fine.</p>
                  <p>In the third year of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 1326. <hi>Robert Baldock</hi> the Kings Chancellor was put into <hi>Newgate.</hi> In 1237, Sir <hi>John Pouitney</hi> gave four Marks a year for releif of the Priſoners in <hi>Newgate.</hi> In 1358, <hi>William Walworth</hi> gave likewiſe toward their relief, and ſo have many others ſince. In 1414, the Jaylors in <hi>Ludgate</hi> and <hi>Newgate</hi> died, and 64 Priſoners. In 1418, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56661:12"/>of <hi>Wertham</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> was Impriſoned in <hi>Newgate.</hi> In the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> 6, 1412. The Executors of <hi>Richard Whittington</hi> repaired <hi>Newgate.</hi> And <hi>Thomas Knowles</hi> Grocer, ſometimes L. Mayor, brought the waſt water from the Ceſtern near St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Chappel, by St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Hoſpital to <hi>Newgate</hi> and <hi>Ludgate</hi> for the Accommodation of the Priſoners. In 1431, all the Priſoners in <hi>Ludgate</hi> were conveyed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> by the Sheriffs of <hi>London;</hi> And ſoon after they fetcht from thence 18 Perſons, Freemen of the City, who were led pinioned to the Counters like Felons, by the falſe ſuggeſtion of the Jaylor of <hi>Newgate;</hi> But <hi>Ludgate</hi> was a while after again appointed for Freemen who were Debtors; and they were all carried back again thither.</p>
                  <p>In 1427. There was a great Skirmiſh in the North Countrey between Sir <hi>Thomas Percie,</hi> Lord <hi>Egremond,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Salisburies</hi> Sons, whereby many were wounded and ſlain, but the Lord <hi>Egremond</hi> being taken was found to give the occaſion, and was thereupon condemned by the Kings Council, to pay a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sum of Money to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and in the mean time was committed to <hi>Newgate;</hi> and a while after both he, and his Brother Sir <hi>Richard Percie</hi> brake out by night, and went to the King. The other Priſoners got upon the Leads over the Gate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it againſt the Sheriffs, and all their Officers a great while, till they were forced to call more Citizens to their Aid, who at laſt ſubdued them, and laid them in Irons; Thus much of <hi>Newgate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>LUDGATE</hi> is the next in the VVeſt, and the Sixth Principal Gate of this City, and Hiſtorians ſay, was built by King <hi>Lud,</hi> near 66 years before our Saviours Nativity; which ſhews its great Antiquity; This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built for the VVeſt, as <hi>Aldgate</hi> for the Eaſt.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1215. aforementioned, being the 17th. of King <hi>John,</hi> when the Barons who were in Arms againſt the King, entred this City, and pull'd down
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56661:12"/>the <hi>Jews</hi> Houſes, repairing the VValls and Gates of the City with the Stones thereof; It appeareth that they then repaired or rather new built this Gate; For in 1586 when this Gate was pulled down in order to its being repaired, there was a ſtone found within the wall, which ſeems to have been taken from one of the <hi>Jews</hi> Houſes, there being ſeveral <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters ingraven thereon, which being interpreted are thus in <hi>Engliſh; This is the Station or Ward of Rabbi</hi> Moſes, <hi>the Son of the Honourable Rabbi</hi> Iſaac. This it is thought had been fixed upon one of the <hi>Jews</hi> Houſes, as a ſign he lived there.</p>
                  <p>In 1260, <hi>Ludgate</hi> was repaired, and beautified with the Images of <hi>Lud</hi> and other Kings, but in the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. theſe Images of the Kings had their Heads ſmitten off, and were defaced, by ſuch as judged every Image to be an Idol; In the Reign of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> they were repaired and new heads ſet upon their old Bodies, which remained ſo, till the 28 of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1586. VVhen this Gate was quite taken down and nobly Rebuilt, with the Images of K. <hi>Lud</hi> and others on the Eaſt-ſide, and Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on the VVeſt, which was done at the City Charge being above 1500 pounds.</p>
                  <p>In 1463. <hi>Stephen Foster</hi> Fiſhmonger, and Dame <hi>Agnes</hi> his VVife, added ſeveral large Rooms to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> and gave other releif to the Priſoners, who are only ſuch Citizens as are Debtors; All Perſons for Treaſons, Felonies, and other Criminal Offences being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Newgate.</hi> In one of theſe rooms, there was a Copper Plate hanging with the following Rhimes ingraven thereon.</p>

                  <p>This Gate (as well as <hi>Newgate</hi>) in the late diſmal Fire in 1666, was burnt down, but ſince they are both repaired and very curiouſly Beautified having a new. Poſtern for Foot Paſſengers added thereto; with ſeveral other Conveniencies. Thus much for <hi>Ludgate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next to this before the late Fire, there was only a breach in the VVall of the City and a Bridge of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber over <hi>Fleet</hi> Ditch; directly againſt <hi>Bridewell</hi> Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but ſince, it is all laid open, and a handſome Bridge of Stone built in that Place, the Ditch being very much enlarged, and a VVharf made of Stone, and cleared from all Houſes on each ſide up to <hi>Holborn</hi> Bridge. The Bridge likewiſe at the lower end of <hi>Ludgate</hi> Hill being nobly rebuilt, or rather new built and made much broader, and another Gallant Bridge is built upon the ſame Ditch almoſt over againſt the <hi>Fleet</hi> Priſon. All this has been done ſince the diſmal Fire, to the very great Charge of the City. And ſo much for the Gates in the Wall.</p>
                  <p>Now for the VVatergates on the Banks of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Thames,</hi> which formerly have been many, though moſt, or all of them have been ruined by the late Fire, however take a breif Account of what they were. <hi>Black Fryers</hi> Stairs is a free landing place now gallantly rebuilt with a uſeful Bridge by Sir <hi>Tho. Fitch,</hi> who has built a very curious houſe upon the VVharf, and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, ſo that now the Lord Mayor when he comes from <hi>Westminster</hi> to be ſworn Lands there, inſtead of <hi>Pauls Wharf,</hi> as being much more convenient. Then there is <hi>Puddle Wharf, Pauls Wharf, Broken Wharf,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides divers others all along the River which are made by the Citizens for their Private uſe. Next is <hi>Ripa Regina,</hi> the Queens Bank, or <hi>Queen Hyth,</hi> which was accounted the Cheif and Principal VVatergate of this City, far exceeding <hi>Billings-Gate,</hi> as it appears in <hi>Queen-hithe</hi> VVard.</p>

                  <p>The next was called <hi>Wolfes Gate</hi> in the <hi>Ropary,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward called <hi>Wolfes lane,</hi> but now out of uſe. The next was called <hi>Ebgate</hi> of old time, as appeareth by Ancient Records, and ſtood near St. <hi>Lawrence Pount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys</hi> Church, it is now a narrow Lane, and called <hi>Eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate lane,</hi> but uſually the <hi>Old Swan.</hi> There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gate at the Bridgfoot called <hi>Oyſter Gate,</hi> of Oyſters that were there ſold, that being the Market-place for them, and other ſmall Fiſh; But now there ſtandeth an Engine to carry up the water into the City in the place thereof.</p>
                  <p>Then there is the <hi>BRIDG-GATE,</hi> ſo called of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Bridge whereon it ſtandeth; This long before the Conqueſt was one of the four firſt, or Principal Gates of the City, where there was only a Bridge of Timber, and is the ſeventh and laſt Principal Gate mentioned by <hi>Fitz Stephen;</hi> when the Bridge was new built of Stone, this Gate was rebuilt again; In the year 1436, this Gate with the Tower upon it fell down, and two of the furtheſt Arches of the Bridg, Southward fell therewith, yet none were killed, or hurt thereby; to the repairing whereof ſeveral Citizens gave very Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. When the Baſtard <hi>Fauconbridg</hi> aforenamed came with the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Mariners into this City, they burnt this Gate, and thirteen Houſes beſides on the Bridge, and likewiſe the Brewhouſes at St. <hi>Katherines</hi> and many others in the Suburbs.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56661:15"/>
                  <p>Next hereunto was a Gate, commonly called <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolphs</hi> Gate, of the Pariſh Church adjoyning, This was given; or confirmed by <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> to the Monks of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Then there is <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> which is much uſed by ſmall Ships &amp; Barges, ſo that <hi>Queen Hyth</hi> is almoſt forſaken. It is ſomewhat uncertain why this Gate was ſo named, only <hi>Jeffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> writes, that <hi>Belin</hi> a King of the <hi>Brittains</hi> about 400 years before Chriſts Nativity, built this Gate, and called it after his own name, &amp; that when he was dead his Body was burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Aſhes were put into a veſſel of Braſs, and ſet over that Gate upon an High Pinacle of Stone; yet it doth not ſeem to be ſo Ancient, but rather to have taken the name from ſome late Owner, called (it may be) <hi>Beling,</hi> or <hi>Billing,</hi> as <hi>Somers</hi> Key, <hi>Smarts</hi> Key, <hi>Freſh Warf</hi> and others have done; Then there was a Watergate on the South-end of <hi>Water-lane</hi> by the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe</hi> Key, but of all theſe more hereafter. One other Watergate there was more by the <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and this is the laſt, and fartheſt Gate Eaſtward on the River of <hi>Thames</hi> as far as the City of <hi>London</hi> extends within the Walls.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe Common Water Gates, there were formerly divers private Wharfs, and Keys all along from the Eaſt to the Weſt of this City, on the <hi>Thames</hi> ſide, where Merchants of all Nations landed their Goods, and had Warehouſes, Cellars, and Stowage form them. And in the 42 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. 1258. it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that the Ports of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be ſtrongly Guarded and the Gates of <hi>London</hi> ſhould be newly repaired and diligently kept in the night for fear of <hi>French</hi> deceits.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Tower of</hi> London, <hi>(and other Ancient Towers and Caſtles of this City) with ſeveral Remarkable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happening therein.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe City of <hi>London</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fitz Stephen</hi>) hath in the Eaſt a very Great, and moſt Strong <hi>Palatine</hi> Tower, whoſe Turrets and Walls do riſe from a deep Foundation, the Mortar thereof being tempered with the Bloud of Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>It is the Common Opinion that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> the firſt Conquerour, or indeed Diſcoverer of <hi>Brittain</hi> was the Original Founder thereof and of many other Towers Caſtles and Great Houſes. But there is little Reaſon for it, in regard of his ſhort ſtay here, having other things to think on, deſigning only to diſpatch his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over this Barbarous Countrey, and then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form greater Enterprizes; Neither do the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians mention any ſuch Buildings erected by him here.</p>
                  <p>The more probable Opinion therefore is, That <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour built the Great white and ſquare Tower there about the year of our Lord 1078, as appears by Ancient Records, and that made <hi>Gundulph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Principal Surveyor of the work. The Wall of the City of <hi>London</hi> (as it is aforementioned) was furniſhed formerly with Towers, and Bulwarks in due diſtance from each other; and the River of <hi>Thames</hi> with its Ebbing and Flowing had overthrown the Walls and Towers on the Banks thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour for the defence of the City which lay open to the Enemy, having taken down
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56661:16"/>the ſecond Bulwark in the Eaſt part of the Wall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Thames,</hi> built the Great <hi>White Tower,</hi> which hath been ſince enlarged at ſeveral times with buildings adjoining thereto; This Tower in the 4th. of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> 1092. was much ſhaken and defaced by a great Tempeſt of Wind; but was again repaired by <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, who likewiſe built a Caſtle on the South-ſide thereof toward the <hi>Thames,</hi> intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame round about. Hiſtorians ſay of this <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rufus, That he challenged the Inveſtiture of Prelates, He pilled, and ſhared the People with Tribute, eſpecially to ſpend about the Tower of</hi> London, <hi>and the Great Hall at</hi> Weſtminſter.</p>
                  <p>The four firſt Conſtables or Keepers of the Tower were <hi>Othowerus, Acolinillus, Otto,</hi> and <hi>Jeffry Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was alſo Sheriff of <hi>London, Middleſex, Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Hertfordſhire;</hi> He fortified the Tower of <hi>London</hi> againſt K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> but the King ſeizing him at his Court at St. <hi>Albans</hi> would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him, till he had delivered it up, together with the Caſtles of <hi>Walden,</hi> and <hi>Plaſhey</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> In 1153, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and Caſtle of <hi>Windſor</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the King to <hi>Richard de Lucie,</hi> to be ſafely kept. In 1155, <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Chancellor to <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. cauſed the <hi>Flemings</hi> to be baniſhed out of <hi>England,</hi> their Caſtles lately built to be demoliſhed, and the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to be repaired.</p>
                  <p>In the 2. of <hi>Rich.</hi> firſt, 1190. <hi>William Longſhamp</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> (by reaſon of ſome difference between him, and Earl <hi>John</hi> the Kings Brother, who was in Rebellion) incloſed the Tower and Caſtle of <hi>London</hi> with an outward Wall of Stone embatailed; and likewiſe cauſed a deep ditch to be made about the ſame, deſigning (as is aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to have invironed it with the River of <hi>Thames.</hi> This incloſure and Ditch took away ſome ground from <hi>Trinity</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> which King <hi>Edward</hi> recompenced. And a great quantity of Ground like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56661:16"/>was taken from the City upon this Account, yet the Citizens had no recompence, nor were offended thereat, ſince it was done with their liking, as being for the defence of the City.</p>
                  <p>But another Hiſtorian ſaith, that in 1239, <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. Fortified the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to another Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and the Citizens fearing it was intended to their detriment, complained to the King; who anſwered, <hi>That he had not done it to their hurt, but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will do from henceforth as my Brother doth, (in building and fortifying Castles) who beareth the name of being wiſer than I.</hi> But the next year, all theſe Noble Buildings of the Stone Gate and Bulwark, were ſhaken as with an Earthquake, and fell down; which the King commanded to be again built better than before. And in the year 1241. Though the King had beſtowed above 12000 Marks in the work, yet the Wall and Bulwarks irrecoverably fell down; at which the Citizens were very well pleaſed; for they were threatned, that when this Wall and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks were built, if any of them ſhould contend for the Liberties of the City they ſhould be Impriſoned therein.</p>
                  <p>Yet were they again rebuilt and finiſhed by <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. and the Bulwark at the Weſt-gate, now called the Lyon Tower, added; the Original of which name, and of Lyons in <hi>England,</hi> we read was thus. <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. built the Mannor of <hi>Woodflock,</hi> and walled the Park about with ſtone, ſeven Miles in compaſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying to that purpoſe divers Villages, Churches and Chappels, and this was the firſt Park in <hi>England,</hi> and as the Record ſaith; <hi>He appointed therein (beſides great ſtore of Deer) divers ſtrange beaſts to be kept and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, ſuch as were brought to him from far Countreys, as Lyons, Leopards, Linxes, Porpentines, and ſuch other, for ſuch was his Estimation among Outlandiſh Princes, that few would willingly offend him.</hi>

                  <p>In the year 1235, we read, that <hi>Frederick</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ſent <hi>Henry</hi> 3. three Leopards in token of his Regal ſheild of Arms, wherein they were pictured; ſince which time, the Lyons, and other Creatures have been kept in a part of this Bulwark now called the <hi>Lyons Tower.</hi> In the 16 of <hi>Edward</hi> 3. One Lyon, One Lyonefs, One Leopard and two Cattes Lyons were committed to the cuſtody of <hi>Robert Boure. Edw.</hi> 4. Fortified the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and incloſed a peice of Ground (Weſt from the <hi>Lyon Tower</hi>) upon <hi>Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill</hi> with brick, now called the Bulwark. And in the 6th. year of his Reign, he ordered a Scaffold and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be ſet upon the Hill for the Execution of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders upon which the L.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> the 3. and <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. repaired this Tower; but in the 2. of <hi>Edward</hi> 6, 1548. <hi>Nov.</hi> 22. A <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> lodging in the round Bulwark, between the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and the <hi>Poſtern,</hi> by ſetting fire to a Barrel of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder in the night, blew up that Bulwark, yet burnt none but himſelf; this Bulwark was ſoon rebuilt again. This weſt Gate of the Tower is the Principal Gate, for receiving, and delivering all manner of Carriages, and without it, there are divers Bulwarks and Gates turning to the North; within this Gate to the South is a ſtrong Poſtern for Paſſengers, by the VVard-houſe, over a Drawbridge, which is let down, and pull'd up at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Next to this on the South ſide Eaſt-ward, is a large VVater-gate (commonly called <hi>Traytors Gate,</hi> becauſe ſome have been carried in that way) this Gate is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under a ſtrong Stone Bridge from the River of <hi>Thames.</hi> Beyond which was a ſmall Poſtern with a Drawbridge ſeldom let down but for receiving in ſome Great Perſons Priſoners; Further to the Eaſt was a

And ſo much for the Foundation, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repairing of the Tower, with the Gates and Poſterns. There are many Fair Houſes within the walls of the Tower, wherein the Officers belonging thereto, and other Inhabitants live, there is alſo a Chappel.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1196, <hi>William Fitz Ozbet</hi> a Citizen, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiouſly moving the People to ſtand up for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and not to be ſubject to the Rich and Mighty, was taken, and brought before the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the Tower where he was condemned by the Judges, and being drawn thence by the Heels to the <hi>Elms</hi> in <hi>East-Smithfield,</hi> he was there hanged. In 1214. King <hi>John</hi> writ to <hi>Jeffery Magnaville</hi> to deliver the Tower of <hi>London</hi> with the Priſoners, Armour, and all other things found therein belonging to the King, to <hi>William</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Huntington.</hi> In the firſt of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. 1216. the Tower was delivered to <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Franse,</hi> and the Barons of <hi>England.</hi> In 1206 Pleas of the Crown were pleaded in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and divers times afterward. In 1222, the Citizens having made a Tumult againſt the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminster, Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> of <hi>Burg,</hi> Cheif Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> ſent for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to enquire who were Principal Authors thereof.

                  <p>In 1244, <hi>Griffith</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> being a Priſoner in the Tower, attempted an eſcape, and having in the night tyed the Sheets, and hangings together he endeavoured thereby to ſlide from the top of the High Tower, but being a Fat man the weight of his Body brake the Rope, and he fell; The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56661:18"/>he was found dead, his head and neck being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into his Breaſt between the Shoulders. In 1253, K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. impriſoned the Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> in the Tower above a Month, about the eſcape of a Priſoner out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> as is aforementioned. In 1260, this King with his Queen (for fear of the Barons) lodged in the Tower; And the next year he ſent for his Lords, and held his Parliament there.</p>
                  <p>In 1263, As the Queen was going by water from the Tower toward <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſeveral Citizens got together upon <hi>London Bridge,</hi> under which ſhe was to paſs, who not only uſed reproachful words againſt her, but threw ſtones and dirt at her, forcing her to go back again, but in 1265. they were forced to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the King for it, and the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Sheriffs were ſent to ſeveral Priſons; <hi>Othon,</hi> Conſtable of the Tower, being made <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the City.</p>
                  <p>About this time, <hi>Leoline</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> came down from the Mountain of <hi>Snowdon</hi> to <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and was taken at <hi>Bluith</hi> Caſtle, where uſing reproachful words againſt the <hi>Engliſh, Roger le Strange</hi> fell upon him, and with his own ſword cut off his head, leaving his dead body on the Ground; Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> cauſed this Head to be ſet upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> crowned with a wreath of Ivy; And this was the end of <hi>Leoline,</hi> who was betrayed by the Men of <hi>Bluith,</hi> and was the laſt Prince of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> bloud who Ruled in <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In 1290, Several Judges as well of the Kings Bench as the Aſſize, were ſent Priſoners to the Tower, and with great Sums of Money obtained their Liberty; Sir <hi>Thomas Weyland</hi> had all his Eſtate confiſcated, and himſelf baniſhed; Sir <hi>Ralph Hengham</hi> Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> paid 7000 Marks; Sir <hi>John Lovet</hi> Cheif Juſtice of the Lower Bench 3000 Marks.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56661:18"/>in Bribery and Injuſtice; <hi>Robert Littlebury</hi> Clerk paid 1000 Marks; and <hi>Roger Leiceſter</hi> as much. But a certain Clerk of the Courts, called <hi>Adam de Straton</hi> paid thirty two thouſand Marks of Old and new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, beſides Jewels without number, and precious veſſels of Silver, which were found in his Houſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a Kings Crown, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>In the 14 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. The King allowed to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the Tower, two pence a day to a Knight; and a peny a day to an Eſquire for their Diet. In 1320. The Kings Juſtices ſate in the Tower, for Trial of divers matters, at which time <hi>John Giſſors,</hi> late Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and ſeveral others fled to the City, for fear of being charged with things they had preſumptuouſly done. The next year the <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> yeilding themſelves to King <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. he ſent them Priſoners to the Tower, where they were condemned to be drawn, and hanged. But <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> of <hi>Wigmore,</hi> by giving his Keepers ſleepy drink; made his eſcape, but his Uncle <hi>Mortimer</hi> died there, above 5 years afterward.</p>
                  <p>In 1326. The Citizens of <hi>London</hi> took poſſeſſion of the Tower, and taking away the keys from the Conſtable, they diſcharged all the Priſoners, and kept both the City and Tower for the uſe of Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> and her ſon <hi>Edward,</hi> (who was afterward <hi>Edw.</hi> the III.)</p>
                  <p>In 1330, <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> was taken, and committed to the Tower, from whence he was drawn to the Elmes, and their hanged on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gallows, where he hung two days and two nights by the Kings Command, and was then buried in the <hi>Gray Friers</hi> Church; This Earl was condemned by his Peers, and yet was never brought to make his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before them. He himſelf having procured a Law to that purpoſe, by which the Earls of <hi>Lancaſter,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56661:19"/>Wincheſter, Gloceſter,</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> were put to death, and now he himſelf ſuffered by the ſame Law.</p>
                  <p>In the 3. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 1344. The King commanded <hi>Florences</hi> of Gold to be coyned in the Tower; <hi>Perce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val de Port,</hi> of <hi>Lake,</hi> being then Maſter of the Mint, and this is the firſt coining we read of there; we read likewiſe that the ſame year the King appointed his Exchange of Money to be kept in <hi>Sernes</hi> Tower, being part of the Kings Houſe in <hi>Buckles</hi> (or <hi>Bucklers</hi>) <hi>Bury.</hi> And we find that in former times all great Sums were paid by weight, that is, ſo many pounds or Marks of Gold or Silver cut into blank peices without any ſtamp upon them, and ſmaller Sums were paid in <hi>Starlings</hi> which were pence ſo called, for they had no other Moneys; This <hi>Starling,</hi> or <hi>Eaſterling</hi> money, took its name, as it is judged, from the <hi>Eaſterlings</hi> which firſt made it in <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. though others imagine it ſo called from a Star ſtamped in the Ring or Edge of the Peny; or of a Bird called a Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtamped on it; others yet more unlikely, of being coyned at <hi>Striveling</hi> or <hi>Sterling,</hi> a Town in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but the firſt Opinion ſeems the moſt probable:</p>
                  <p>In 1360. A Peace being concluded between <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>France, Edward</hi> the 3d. came back into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and went to the Tower to viſit the <hi>French</hi> King, who was Priſoner there, ſetting his Ranſome at three Millions of <hi>Florences,</hi> which being paid, he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from his Impriſonment and the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him with Honour to the Seaſide.</p>
                  <p>In the 4th. of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. 1381. A grievous Tax was laid upon the Subjects, which cauſed much Trouble. For the Courtiers, greedy to inrich themſelves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the King that the Tax was not ſo carefully ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered as it ought; And therefore they would pay a great Sum of Money to Farm it, which they would raiſe above what it was before, by being more ſevere in gathering it. This Propoſition was ſoon accepted, ſo that having the Kings Authority, and Letters, theſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56661:19"/>Farmers or Commiſſioners, met in ſeveral Places in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> where they levied this Tax of Groats, or Polemoney, with all manner of ſeverity, which ſo diſcontented the People, that they combined together, and reſiſted the Collectors, killing ſome, wounding others, and making the reſt fly.</p>
                  <p>The Tumult began firſt in <hi>Kent,</hi> upon this occaſion, (as it is related in the Chronicles of St. <hi>Albans</hi>) One of theſe Exactors coming to the Houſe of <hi>John</hi> (others ſay) <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> living at <hi>Dartford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> demanded of <hi>Tylers</hi> Wife, a Groat a piece for her Husband, her ſelf, and Servants, and likewiſe for a young Maiden her Daughter; The woman paid for all but her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, alleaging ſhe was a Child, and underage to pay; <hi>That will I ſoon know,</hi> (quoth the Collector) and ſhamefully turned the young Maids Coats up, to ſee whether ſhe were come to ripeneſs of Age; (theſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains having in divers other Places made the like baſe; and uncivil Trials.) Hereupon the Mother crying out, divers of the Neighbours came in, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being at work in the Town, tyling a houſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, taking his Lathing-ſtaff in his hand, ran home, and finding the Collector, asked him, who made him ſo bold? the Collector returned ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ſtruck at <hi>Tyler,</hi> who avoiding the blow, gave the Collector ſuch a home-blow with his Lathing-ſtaff, that his Brains flew out of his head; which made a great uproar in the Streets, and the People being glad at what had happened, they prepared to defend and ſtand by <hi>Tyler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thereupon a great number of them being got together, they went from thence to <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> and then to <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> perſwading, and Exhorting all the People as they marched along to join with them in this common Cauſe, and ſetting Guards upon all the ways to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> they ſtopped all Paſſengers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them to ſwear; <hi>That they would keep Allegiance to King</hi> Richard, <hi>and to the Commons; That they would
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56661:20"/>accept of no King whoſe name was</hi> John, (becauſe of the hatred they had to <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf King of <hi>Caſtile</hi>) <hi>And that they ſhould be ready when they were called, and ſhould agree to no Tax to be levied from thenceforth in the Kingdom, nor conſent to any, except it were a Fifteenth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There joyned with them one <hi>John Ball</hi> a factious Clergyman, who took occaſion to rip up the grounds of the Miſ-government, telling the People, <hi>That this difference of Mens Eſtates, where ſome were Potentates, and others Bondmen, was againſt Christian Liberty,</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Text this old Rhyme,
<q>
                        <l>When <hi>Adam</hi> Delv'd and <hi>Eve</hi> Span,</l>
                        <l>Who was then a Gentleman.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſo incenſed the Commons that their Number daily increaſed, ſo that when they were come as far as <hi>Blackheath,</hi> they were eſteemed to be an Hundred Thouſand, ſo that fearing no reſiſtance, they began to commit all manner of Violence, ſparing none whom they thought to be learned eſpecially if they found a pen or Inkhorn about him, for then they pull'd off his Hood, and with one Voice cryed out, <hi>Hale him out, and cut off his head.</hi> The King ſent ſome Knights to them to know the cauſe of their Aſſembling, To whom they anſwered, <hi>That for certain Cauſes they were come together, and deſired to talk with the King, and therefore willed the Knights to tell him, That he must needs come to them, that he might understand the deſire of their Hearts.</hi> The King was adviſed by ſome to go preſently to them, but <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Lord Chancellor, and <hi>Robert Hales</hi> of St. <hi>Johns,</hi> Treaſurer, affirmed, <hi>That it was not fit for the King to go to ſuch a rude Company, but rather to take Order to ſuppreſs them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This the Commons hearing, were ſo enraged, that they ſwore, <hi>They would go ſeek the Kings Traytors, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56661:20"/>cut off their beads;</hi> And thereupon they marched into <hi>Southwark,</hi> and ruined the Archbiſhops Palace at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> out of ſpight to him. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen fearing they would do the like to the City, ordered the Gates to be ſhut, but the Commoners of the City, eſpecially the Poorer ſort, favouring the Commoners of the Countrey, threatned death to all that ſhould attempt it; So that the Rebels had free Egreſs, and Regreſs in and out of <hi>London,</hi> and dayly incouraged the Citizens to favour their Cauſe, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Their Purpoſe was only to bring the Traytors of the Land to Juſtice, and then they would lay down their Arms;</hi> And hereby they won them to ſtand by them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing they did when they came to <hi>London</hi> was to ſend for one <hi>Richard Lyon</hi> a Grave Citizen, who had been <hi>Tylers</hi> Maſter, and having ſtruck off his head, they carried it upon a Pole in Triumph before them. The next day they came to the <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancasters</hi> Houſe, which they ſet on fire, burning all his rich Furniture, breaking in peices all his Plate and Jewels, and throwing them into the <hi>Thames,</hi> ſaying, <hi>They were men of Juſtice, and would not like Robbers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves with any mans Goods, for they only were for destroying Traytors;</hi> And when one of their Fellows was eſpied to thruſt a fair piece of Silver into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, they took him, and caſt both him and it into the Fire; neither took they any thing from any man but at the juſt price. Two and thirty of them were got into the <hi>Dukes</hi> Wine-cellar, where they ſtayed drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long, till the Rafters of the Houſe, which was on Fire, fell upon them, and ſo covered them, that not able to get out, they were heard cry ſeven days after, and then periſhed.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Savoy</hi> they went to the <hi>Temple</hi> where they burnt the Lawyers Chambers, with their Books, and Writings, and all they could lay hands on. Alſo the Noble Houſe of St. <hi>Johns,</hi> by <hi>Smithfield</hi> they ſet on

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56661:21"/>they cried out with a great noiſe, <hi>That they did not fear the Interdiction, neither did allow the Pope to be above them.</hi> The Archbiſhop ſeeing death at hand, ſpoke them fairly, and granting forgiveneſs to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, he kneeled down and offered his Head to be cut off; The Hangman ſtruck him on the neck but not deadly, he putting up his hand, ſaid, <hi>Aha, it is the hand of God;</hi> and being ſtruck again before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his hand, his fingers ends were cut off, and part of the Arteries; with which he fell down, but died not, till they had mangled him with eight ſeveral ſtrokes in the Neck and Head. His body lay two days unburied, none daring to do it; His Head they cut off, and nailing his hood thereon, fixt it upon a Pole on <hi>London</hi> Bridge.

                     <hi>Robert Knowls</hi> a Freeman of the City came at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, whom they all deſired to be their Leader, which he willingly accepted, and ſo with the Lord Mayor and ſome other Knights, they were led to the King, who with all his Company rejoyced very much at this unexpected Aſſiſtance from theſe brave armed Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, who all on a ſudden incompaſſed the whole Body of the Commons.</p>
                  <p>And here in an inſtant was a very ſtrange and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Alteration, for the Commons preſently threw down their Arms, and falling on their knees begg'd Pardon, and they who juſt before boaſted that they had the Kings Life in their power, were now glad to hide themſelves in Caves, Ditches and Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields; The Knights being deſirous of revenge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the King, <hi>that they might be permitted to take off the heads of an hundred or two of them;</hi> but the King would not grant it, but commanded the Charter which they demanded written, and ſealed, to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them at that time, for preventing further miſchief, as doubting if they were not ſatisfied, the Commons of <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Kent</hi> might riſe again. Having got their Charter they departed home.</p>
                  <p>The Commons being thus diſperſed and gone, the King called for the worthy Lord Mayor, and with great Honour deſervedly Knighted him in the Field, and gave him a hundred pound a year in Fee, he alſo Knighted five Aldermen his Brethren, girding them about the waſte with the Girdle of Knighthood, as the manner was in thoſe days; but <hi>Stow</hi> ſaith, it was thus, To cauſe the Perſon to put a Baſenet on his Head, and then the King with a Sword in both his Hands to ſtrike him ſtrongly on the Neck. And for an Eternal Remembrance of this happy day, the King for the Honour of the City granted that a Dagger ſhould be added to the Arms of the City, in the right Quarter of the Shield, they before this time bearing only a Croſs without the Dagger.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:56661:24"/>
                  <p>After this the King marched into the City with great Joy, and went to His Mother, who lodged in the <hi>Tower Royal,</hi> called then the <hi>Queens Wardrobe,</hi> where ſhe had continued two days, and nights in great fear, and trouble; But when ſhe ſaw the King ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly comforted, ſaying, <hi>Ah fair Son, what great ſorrow have I ſuffered for you this day;</hi> To whom the King anſwered, <hi>Certainly, Madam, I know it well, but now rejoyce, and thank God, for I have this day recovered mine Inheritance, and the Realm of</hi> England, <hi>which I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt.</hi> Then the Arch-Biſhops Head was taken off <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and <hi>Wat Tylers</hi> ſet up in the Place.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince ſome Writers have reported that the Rebel ſo Valiantly ſtruck down by Sir <hi>William Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> was named <hi>Jack Straw,</hi> and not <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> it may be neceſſary to give an Account of the Principal Leaders, and Captains of the Commons; of whom <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> was the Cheif, as being the firſt man who judged himſelf offended, there were likewiſe <hi>Jack Straw, John Kirkby, Allen Thredder, Thomas Scot,</hi> and <hi>Ralph Rugg;</hi> theſe and divers others were Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> men.</p>
                  <p>And at the ſame time there were gathered together to the number of fifty thouſand in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of <hi>John Wraw</hi> a lewd Prieſt, who made one <hi>Robert Westbrome</hi> take upon him the name of King, theſe fell to deſtroying Houſes, but eſpecially thoſe of Lawyers, and ſeizing Sir <hi>John Cavendiſh</hi> Lord Cheif Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> they beheaded him and ſet his Head upon the Pillory in St. <hi>Edmundsbury.</hi> The like Commotion of the Commons was at the ſame time alſo in <hi>Cambridgſhire,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and <hi>Norfolk,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by <hi>John Litester</hi> a Dyer; and to countenance their proceedings the more, they deſigned to have brought <hi>William Ufford</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> into their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, but he having notice of their intent, ſuddenly roſe from ſupper and got away.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56661:25"/>
                  <p>Yet they compelled many other Lords, and Knights to be ſworn to them, and to ride with them, as the Lord <hi>Scales,</hi> the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> Sir <hi>John Brewis,</hi> Sir <hi>Stephen Hales,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Salle,</hi> the laſt of whom not enduring their Inſolencies, had his Brains daſhed out by a Countrey-man that was his Bondman; The reſt terrified by his Example were glad to carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſubmiſſively to their Commander, <hi>John Littester,</hi> who named himſelf King of the Commons, and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it a Preferment for any to ſerve him at his Table, in taking Aſſay of his Meats and Drinks, with kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbly before him as he ſate at Meat.</p>
                  <p>And now theſe Fellows upon Conſultation ſend two Choice Men, namely the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Brewis,</hi> with three of their Chief Commons to the King for their Charter of Manumiſſion, and freedom from Bondage; who being on their way, they were met near <hi>Newmarket</hi> by <hi>Henry Spenſer</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> who examining if there were any of the Rebels in their Company, and finding three of the Chief preſent, he inſtantly cauſed their Heads to be ſtruck off, and then purſued on toward <hi>Northwalſham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> where the Commons ſtayed for an Anſwer from the King, and though he had at firſt but eight Lances, and a ſmall number of Archers in his Company, yet they ſo increaſed, as to become a compleat Army, with which he ſet upon the Rebels, and routed them, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>John Litteſter</hi> and other Principal Ringleaders, whom he cauſed all to be Executed, and by this means the Countrey was quieted.</p>

                     <p>At the ſame time when we were Aſſembled upon <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> and had ſent to the King to come to us, our purpoſe was to have ſlain all ſuch Knights, Eſquires and Gentlemen as attended him; And for the King, we would have kept him amongſt us, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have more boldly repaired to us, ſince they would have thought that whatever we did, was by his Authority; Finally when we had got ſtrength enough, ſo as not to fear any attempt made againſt us, we would have ſlain all ſuch Noblemen, as ſhould either have given Counſel, or made Reſiſtance againſt us, but eſpecially we would have ſlain all the Knights of the <hi>Rhodes</hi> or St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and laſtly we would have killed the King himſelf, and all men of Eſtates, with Biſhops, Monks, Canons, and Parſons of Churches; Only we would have ſaved <hi>Friers Mendicants</hi> for Miniſtring the Sacraments to us.</p>
                     <p>When we had been rid of all theſe, we would have deviſed Laws, according to which the Subjects of this Realm ſhould have lived; For we would have created Kings, as <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and others in other Countreys; But becauſe this our purpoſe was diſappointed by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who would not permit the King to come to us, we ſought by all means to diſpatch him out of the way, as at length we did; And further, the ſame Evening that <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> was killed, we were reſolved (having the greateſt part of the Commons of the City inclined to join with us) to have ſet Fire in four corners of the City and ſo to have devided among our ſelves the Spoil of the chiefeſt Riches that could have been found; And this (ſaid he) was our purpoſe, as God may help me now at my laſt end.</p>

                  <p>After this Confeſſion he was beheaded and his head was ſet on <hi>London Bridge</hi> by <hi>Wat Tylers;</hi> And thus by the happy and proſperous ſucceſs at <hi>London,</hi> this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rebellion was fully quieted.</p>

                  <p>In 1392. and the Fifteenth of <hi>Richard</hi> II. there happened ſome difference between that King and the <hi>Londoners;</hi> One occaſion was, that the King would have borrowed of them a thouſand pound, but they feeling much and fearing more the Kings daily Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only refuſed it, but abuſed a certain <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant who would have laid down the Money. Another occaſion was, That one of the Biſhop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisburies</hi> Servants named <hi>Walter Roman</hi> taking an Houſe Loaf out of a Bakers basket in the Streets, ran with it into the Biſhops Houſe; The Citizens demanded the delivery of the Offender, but the Biſhops men ſhut the Gates, and would not ſuffer the Conſtable to enter, upon which many people got together, threatning to break open the Gates, and Fire the Houſe unleſs <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> were brought forth; <hi>What</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>are the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops men Priviledged? or is his houſe a Sanctuary? or will he protect thoſe whom he ought to puniſh? if we may be abuſed in this manner, not only our Streets, but our Shops and Houſes ſhall never be free from violence, and wrong, this we neither will, nor can endure, for it doth not become us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereupon they approached the Gates with great Fury; But the Lord Mayor, and Sheriffs having notice hereof, came to them and told them; <hi>That this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>as not Courage but Outrage which they ſhewed, whereby they would procure both danger to themſelves, and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt the whole City, and that though wrong had been done, yet they were not the Perſons, neither was this the way to redreſs the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus partly by perſwaſion, and partly by their Preſence and Authority, they ſuppreſſed the Riot and ſent every man home, with ſtrict charge to keep the Peace. Hitherto there was no great miſcheif done, and the quarrel might have been ended without any further trouble, had not the Biſhops ſtirred in it, and kindled the Coals of Contention afreſh. For the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> were at that time not only ſecretly ſuſpected, but openly noted to be Favourers and Followers of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:56661:27"/>Opinions, (which were contrary to the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) and upon that account the Biſhops were malicious againſt them, and moſt of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were interpreted to proceed from other Cauſes, and to tend to worſe Purpoſes than they outwardly ſeemed to bear, yea many accidental matters were charged upon them to be done out of Deſign, and on purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>John Waltham</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> made a grievous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt them for this laſt Attempt to <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and Lord Chancellor; alledging, <hi>That if upon every ſlight pretence, the Citizens ſhould be ſuffered in this manner, to affront the Biſhops without reproof, or puniſhment, they would endanger not only the Dignity and State, but the Liberty of the whole Church alſo; For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>did they not lately take upon them the puniſhment of Adulteries, and other Crimes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, maliciouſly alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That either the Biſhops and their Officers were infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for thoſe Vices themſelves, and did therefore Connive at the ſame in others; Or elſe by Covetous Commutation and taking of Money, did rather ſet thoſe ſins to Sale, than endeavour carefully to ſuppreſs them. Did they not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>rudely, and irreverently break open the doors upon the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and interrupt his Proceedings againſt</hi> John Aſton, <hi>an open Diſciple of</hi> Wickliff, <hi>and do we imagine that this is the laſt Indignity they will offer? no certainly, nor yet the leaſt, for if this boldneſs, and Inſolence be not ſuppreſt. our Authority will ſoon fall into Contempt and Scorn, and will be made a Common Football for every baſe and unworthy Citizen to kick at.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Armed with theſe furious Arguments, they went together to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and ſo incenſed him againſt the <hi>Londoners,</hi> (his Mind being before prepared by former Provocations) that he was once reſolved to have utterly ruined, and deſtroyed the whole City;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56661:27"/>But being perſwaded to uſe more Moderation, he in Revenge, firſt cauſed the Lord Maior, Sheriffs, and many of the Principal Citizens to be committed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Priſons, the Lord Mayor to <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, and others to other Places; and then ſeized the Liberties of the City into his hands declaring, that no Lord Mayor ſhould for the future be Elected any more, but that the King ſhould at his Pleaſure appoint a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or Governour over the City. And this Office was firſt committed to Sir <hi>Edward Darlington,</hi> who for his kindneſs toward the City was ſoon removed, and Sir <hi>Baldwin Radington</hi> put in his place.</p>
                  <p>The King was likewiſe perſwaded by <hi>Arundel</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York</hi> to remove the Terms and Courts, that is, the <hi>Chancery, Exchequer, Kings Bench,</hi> the <hi>Hamper</hi> Office and the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> where they continued from <hi>Midſummer</hi> 1393. till <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> next following, to the great dammage, and loſs of the City of <hi>London;</hi> But at laſt upon the earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of the Dukes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter</hi> his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the King ſent for the <hi>Londoners</hi> before him to <hi>Windſor,</hi> where having firſt terrified them with the ſight of a great Number of Souldiers, he cauſed all the Priviledges and Charters of the City, both old, and new to be produced, ſome of which he reſtored to them, and detained others. Yet were not the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens received fully into favour, neither did they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Perſon or Dignity of their Lord Mayor at that time.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the King went to <hi>London,</hi> at whoſe coming the Citizens turned all their Greif into Joy (the Vulgar being without meaſure in both) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him with ſuch joyful Triumphs, and Rich Preſents, as if it had been the day of his Coronation, thinking by all theſe coſtly preparations, to have paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all former Anger, and diſpleaſure againſt them, but they found themſelves much deceived, there being no Reconciliation to be made without Money; for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56661:28"/>they were not abſolutely reſtored to their Liberties till they had paid Ten Thouſand pound to the King as a Fine. Thus did the <hi>Londoners</hi> ſhew a ſtrange diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Diſpoſition, in raſhly committing an Offence, and patiently induring puniſhment, yet upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as ſoon as the firſt occaſion was offered againſt King <hi>Richard</hi> they ſhewed themſelves either his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Enemies, or faint Friends, as by the ſequel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
                  <p>In 1387.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> the II. was the only Son of a Renowned Father, <hi>Edward</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> who died before his Father, <hi>Edward</hi> III. and thereupon <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> was by his Grandfather in his Life-time, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his Heir and lawful Succeſſor, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Death was Crowned King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter, July</hi> 16. 1377. But being of tender age, only eleven years old, ſeveral Perſons were commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to be his Protectors, or Guardians; and ſoon after a Parliament was called at <hi>Westminster,</hi> wherein <hi>Alice Peirce</hi> the late Kings Concubine, was baniſhed, and all her Goods Confiſcate; and two Tenths of the Clergy, and two Fifteenths of the Temporality were granted, but ſo as that two Citizens of <hi>London, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Walworth,</hi> and <hi>John Philpot</hi> ſhould receive, and keep it, to ſee it beſtowed for defence of the Realm. At which time Sir <hi>Hugh Calverly</hi> Deputy of <hi>Callice,</hi> burnt 26 <hi>French</hi> Ships in the Haven of <hi>Bulloigne;</hi> But one <hi>Mercer,</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Pyrate came to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> and took divers Ships, committing likewiſe many Outrages, and no Order being taken to repel them, <hi>John Philpot</hi> ſet out a Fleet at his own Charge, and encountring him in his own Perſon, took <hi>Mercer</hi> and all his Ships, and returning home, inſtead of being rewarded for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56661:28"/>his Service, he was queſtioned for preſuming to fit out a Navy without Advice of the Kings Council.</p>
                  <p>While the King was in his Minority matters were carried indifferent well, but in the year 1387, King <hi>Richard</hi> begins to enter, as we may ſay, upon the Confines of his Deſtiny; His Gracing of undeſerving Men, and Diſgracing of Men deſerving, if they were not the Cauſes, were at leaſt the occaſions of his own Diſgracing; He was now come to be of full Age to do all himſelf, which was indeed to be of full Age to undo himſelf, for the Errors of his younger years might be excuſed by inexperience, but the faults of the Age he was now of, admit of no Apology, nor defence; And to haſten his deſtiny the ſooner, the Evil Counſel which was formerly but whiſpered in his Ear, they now had the Confidence to give him aloud; For it was told him, <hi>That he was under Tuition no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and therefore not to be controlled as formerly he had been; That to be croſt of his will by his Subjects, was to be their Subject; That he is no Soveraign, if he be not Abſolute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the inſtigation of ſuch Counſellors as theſe, the King in a Parliament then Aſſembled fell to expoſtulate with the Lords, asking them, <hi>What years they thought him to be of;</hi> who anſwering, <hi>That he was ſomewhat more than one and Twenty; Well then,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I am out of your Wardſhip, and expect to enjoy my Kingdom as freely as you your ſelves at the like years enjoy your Patrimonies.</hi> But (ſaith our Author) his flattering Favourites ſhould have remembred, that though the King may not be controlled where he can command, yet he may be oppoſed where he can but demand; as now indeed he was, For when he demanded a Subſidy toward his Wars, He was anſwered, <hi>That he needed no Subſidy from his Subjects, if he would but call in the debts that the Chancellor owed him; and if he were ſo tender, that he could not do that work himſelf, they would do it for him;</hi> And thereupon charged him with ſuch Crimes,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56661:29"/>that all his Goods were Confiſcate, and himſelf adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dye if the King pleaſed. Though others write, his Sentence was only to pay twenty Thouſand Marks as a Fine, and a Thouſand pound beſides yearly.</p>
                  <p>This Chancellor was <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> a Merchants Son, who was lately made Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> who with <hi>Robert Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> and Marqueſs of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſome others, were King <hi>Richards</hi> boſom Favourites; And upon this Provocation given them, they preſently ſtudy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; And thereupon contrive, that the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> (the Kings Uncle) as Principal, and other Lords who croſſed the Kings Courſes, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to a ſupper in <hi>London,</hi> and be there Murdered; In the Execution of which Plot, the late Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember,</hi> was deeply concerned, but the preſent Lord Mayor, <hi>Richard Exton,</hi> though moved thereto by the King himſelf, utterly refuſed to do it, and thereupon this Deſign miſcarried.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding theſe heats, and many more, which paſſed in this Parliament, yet a Subſidy was at laſt granted to the King of half a Tenth, and half a Fifteenth, but with this expreſs Condition, that it ſhould not be paid out, but by order from the Lords, and the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was to receive it; But before this time, it was abſolutely agreed between both Houſes of Parliament, <hi>That unleſs the Chancellor were removed they would proceed no further;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King having notice hereof, ſent a Meſſage to the Houſe of Commons that they ſhould ſend to <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> where he then lay, Forty of their Houſe, to declare their Minds to him; But upon a Conference between both Houſes, it was agreed, That the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> ſhould in the name of the Parliament go to him; who coming to the King, declared. <hi>That by an old Statute the King once a year might lawfully ſummon his Court of Parliament for Reformation of all Enormities and Corruptions within
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56661:29"/>the Realm;</hi> and further declared, <hi>That by an Old Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it was likewiſe Enacted, That if the King ſhould abſent himſelf Forty days not being ſick, the Houſes might lawfully break up, and return home;</hi> At which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the King ſhould ſay, <hi>Well, we perceive our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple go about to riſe against us, and therefore we think we cannot do better, then to ask aid of our Couſen the King of</hi> France, <hi>and rather ſubmit our ſelves to him, than to our own Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the Lords anſwered, <hi>They wondred at his Majeſties Opinion, ſince the</hi> French <hi>King was the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Enemy of the Kingdom, and he might remember what miſchiefs were brought upon the Realm in King</hi> Johns <hi>time by ſuch Courſes.</hi> By theſe and the like perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the King was induced to come to his Parliament, wherein <hi>John Fordham,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> is diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Office of Treaſurer, and <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> of being Chancellor, and others by conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment put in their places; Likewiſe by Order of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, thirteen Lords were appointed under the King to have overſight of the whole Government of the Realm, that is the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> Lord Chancellor; Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> Lord Treaſurer, the Abbot of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> Lord Privy Seal, the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Glocester,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but this diviſion of the Government was ſoon found inconvenient; This Parliament alſo granted to <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> (lately created Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi>) thirty Thouſand Marks (which the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were to give to the heirs of <hi>Charles de Bloys</hi>) upon Condition that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eaſter following he ſhould go over into <hi>Ireland;</hi> So deſirous were the Lords, and Commons to have him removed from the Kings preſence.</p>
                  <p>But though the King gave way to this Torrent of the Parliament at preſent, yet as ſoon as they were Diſſolved, he diſſolved likewiſe all they had done againſt his Favourites, and received them into more Favour than before. A while after the Duke of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56661:30"/>puts away his lawful Wife who was neer a Kin to the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and married one of the Queens Maids a Vintners Daughter, at which the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> was very much offended; which the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> underſtanding ſtudied how by any means he might diſpatch the Duke of <hi>Glocester;</hi> and Eaſter being now paſt which was the time appointed for the Duke to go into <hi>Ireland,</hi> the King pretending to go with him to the Seaſide, went with him unto <hi>Wales,</hi> being attended likewiſe with <hi>Michael de la Pool, Robert Treſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> a prime Favourite, who was Lord Chief Juſtice, and divers others, where they conſulted how to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Arundel, Warwick, Darby, Nottingham,</hi> with divers others of that Party.</p>
                  <p>The King having remained ſome time in thoſe Parts had quite forgotten the Voyage of the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo brought him back with him again to <hi>Nottingham</hi> Caſtle. About the ſame time <hi>Robert Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillian</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice came to <hi>Coventry,</hi> and there Indicted two Thouſand Perſons; The King then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the High Sheriffs of the Counties before him, and demanded what ſtrength they could make for him againſt the Lords, if there ſhould be occaſion; To which they returned anſwer, <hi>That the Common People did ſo favour the Lords, as believing them to be Loyal and true to the King, that it was not in their power to raiſe any great force against them;</hi> They were then commanded to take care, That no Knights nor Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes ſhould afterward he choſen to any Parliament, but thoſe whom the King and his Council ſhould name; They replyed, <hi>It was a hard matter in thoſe times of Jealouſy and ſuſpition, to deprive the People of their Ancient Liberties in chooſing their Repreſentatives;</hi> after which they were diſmiſſed.</p>

                  <p>At this time the <hi>Londoners</hi> incurred much obloquy, for having before been pardoned by the King of ſome Crimes lay'd to their Charge, they were now ready to comply with his deſires, and a Jury of them being Impanneled, they indicted ſome Lords of many crimes laid to their Charge; And now the King, and the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſent into all parts of the Realm to raiſe men in this Quarrel againſt the Lords; And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Mayor of <hi>London</hi> to give an Account how many able men he could raiſe in the City, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>That he thought they could make fifty Thouſand men at an hours warning; Well,</hi> ſaid the King, <hi>go and try what may be done,</hi> But when the Mayor went about it, the Citizens anſwered, <hi>That they would never fight against the Kings Friends, and the Defenders of the Realm;</hi> About this time the King intended to have apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> but he made his eſcape, and with other Lords had got together a great power of men at <hi>Harringey</hi> Park; Upon which the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that no Citizen of <hi>London</hi> ſhould ſell to the D. of <hi>Glocester,</hi> the E. of <hi>Arundel,</hi> or any of the Lords any
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56661:31"/>Armour or Furniture of War under a great penalty.</p>
                  <p>After this the King is perſwaded to ſend to the Lords to come to him to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> upon Oath given by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Chancellor that no fraud nor evil practice ſhould be uſed againſt them, which the Lords were content to do, but when they were ready to come, they underſtood there was an Ambuſh laid to intrap them of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men in the <hi>Mews;</hi> which the King abſolutely denied he had any knowledge of; yet the Lords after this receiving a ſafe Conduct from the King, came to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> of whoſe coming when the King heard, he apparelled himſelf in his Royal Robes, and with his Scepter in his hand came into the Great Hall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the Lords upon their Knees preſented themſelves, the King bidding them welcome, and taking each of them by the hand.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lord Chancellor made a Speech wherein he blamed them for raiſing Arms, deſiring to know the Cauſe; who anſwered, <hi>They had done it for the good of the Kingdom, and to remove the Traytors about the King;</hi> Upon which the King himſelf ſpoke and asked them whether they thought to compel him by ſtrong hand? <hi>Have not I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſufficient power to beat you down? truly in this behalf, I make no more account of you than of the baſeſt Skullion in my Kitchen.</hi> Yet after theſe great words, he lift up the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> who all this while was kneeling, and commanded the reſt alſo to riſe, and then led them Courteouſly to his Chamber, where they ſate and drank together, and at laſt it was concluded they ſhould all meet again, as well theſe Lords, as thoſe they accuſed at the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which the King promiſed he would ſpeedily call, and each party to receive there according to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and in the mean while all Parties ſhould be under the Kings Protection.</p>
                  <p>But when the Favourite Lords heard this, they told the King plainly they neither durſt nor would put
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56661:32"/>themſelves to the hazard of ſuch a Meeting, and therefore the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the reſt of that Faction left the Court to be out of the way; but the King not enduring their abſence appointed <hi>Thomas Molineux,</hi> Conſtable of the Caſtle of <hi>Cheſter</hi> to raiſe an Army, and to ſafe conduct the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> to his preſence; But they being come as far as <hi>Radcoat</hi> Bridge, were encountred by the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> not daring to joyn battel with him fled, and being to paſs a River, caſt away his Gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and ſword to be more nimble, and ſpurring his Horſe lept into the River and ſo eſcaped; though it was reported he was drowned, till news came he was got into <hi>Holland,</hi> where being no welcome Gueſt he wandred up and down two or three years, like a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, and at <hi>Lorain</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> ended his life.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Lords had got matter enough againſt the King, at leaſt to juſtifie their Arms, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with an Army of Forty thouſand men they came to <hi>London,</hi> where after ſome debate, they were received, and ſome of them went to the Tower to the King, to whom after humble Salutations, they ſhewed the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he had written to the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> to levy an Army for their deſtruction; likewiſe the Letters which the <hi>French</hi> King had written to him, containing a ſafe Conduct for him to come into <hi>France,</hi> there to do Acts to his own diſhonour, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                  <p>After which upon the Kings Promiſe that he would come the next day to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to treat further of theſe matters, the Lords departed, only at the Kings deſire the Earls of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Derby</hi> ſtayed all Night, but before the King went to bed, his Mind was quite altered as to keeping promiſe with the Lords, which they underſtanding, ſent peremptorily to him, <hi>That if be came not according to his Word, they would chuſe another King who ſhould hearken to the faithful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his Lords.</hi> This touched the King to the quick,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56661:32"/>ſo that the next morning he went &amp; met them, &amp; they declared to him how much it concerned the good of the Kingdom that thoſe Traitors ſo often ſpoken of, ſhould be removed from the Court; To which the King, though much againſt his Will, at laſt condeſcended, and thereupon the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> fled no man knew whether; the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> Lord Treaſurer, Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> Lord <hi>Burrel,</hi> Lord <hi>Beumont</hi> and others were expelled the Court, and conſtrained to put in Bail to appear the next Parliament; Alſo cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Shortly after the Parliament began, called afterward the Parliament that wrought wonders; On the firſt day whereof, all the Judges but one, were arreſted as they ſate upon the Bench, and ſent to the Tower, and ſeveral Lords and Biſhops were impeached; But the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Treſillian</hi> having made his eſcape, was afterward taken and hanged at <hi>Tyburn;</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember</hi> was Beheaded with an Axe which he had prepared for the beheading of others, after this divers Lords and Knights, and among the reſt the Steward of the Kings Houſehold, were Beheaded on <hi>Tower-hill.</hi> Alſo all the Judges were condemned to dye, but by the Queens Interceſſion, they were only baniſhed the Realm, and all their Lands and Eſtates Confiſcated, only a ſmall Sallery was allowed them for their ſupport. Finally, in this Parliament an Oath was required, and obtained of the King, that he would perform ſuch things as the Lords ſhould Order, and this Oath was likewiſe required of all the People of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>After this the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and ſome other Lords upon diſcontent, conſpire to ſeize upon the King, the Dukes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi>

A General Pardon was alſo granted for all the Kings Subjects but only to Fifty; whoſe names he would not Expreſs, but reſerved them to himſelf, that when any of the Nobility offended him, he might at his Pleaſure name him to be one of the number excepted, and ſo keep them ſtill within his danger. Alſo in this Parliament the Judges gave their Opinious, <hi>That when Articles are propounded by the King to be handled in Parliament, if other Articles be handled before thoſe be first determined, that it is Treaſon in them that do it.</hi> And for the more ſtrengthning the Acts of this Parliament the King purchaſed the Popes Bulls, containing grievous Cenſures, and Curſes to thoſe that ſhould break them.</p>
                  <p>And now the Heads of the Oppoſite Faction having loſt their Heads, and all things as well ſetled as could be deſired, the King was ſecure as thinking himſelf ſafe, and he had been indeed ſafe, if Time and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were not Actors in Revenge as well as men, or rather if a Superiour Power did not interpoſe, whoſe ways are as ſecret as himſelf is invincible. About this time it happened that <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> accuſed each other for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56661:33"/>ſpeaking words ſounding highly to the Kings diſhonour, whereupon a Combate is agreed upon between them, which being ready to be begun, the King interpoſeth, and baniſheth the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> for ever, and the D of <hi>Hereford</hi> for ſix years; But ſoon after ſeveral diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Lords ſollicite the D. of <hi>Hereford</hi> to return into <hi>England,</hi> &amp; take the Government upon him, &amp; they would be ready to aſſiſt him; who thereupon without much deliberation prepares to come over, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Ravenſpur</hi> in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> where many Lords, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Common people repaired to him, to whom he ſolemnly proteſts, <hi>That though ſome of them had invited him to come to take the Government, yet he came only to take poſſeſſion of the Inheritance deſcended to him from his Father, which King</hi> Richard <hi>unjuſtly and contrary to his promiſe had ſeized into his hands.</hi>

                  <p>Hereupon many more Lords join with him, and all the Kings Caſtles are ſurrendred to him, and the Lord <hi>Scroop</hi> Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Buſhy</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Green</hi> being ſeized, were condemned, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, for Miſgoverning the King, and the Realm. King <hi>Richard</hi> was at that time in <hi>Ireland</hi> buſie in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Rebels, and had no notice of the Dukes Arrival in <hi>England</hi> till ſix weeks after; but hearing of it, he ſends the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> before to raiſe an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and promiſeth to come himſelf within ſix days; the Earl provides an Army of Forty Thouſand men, but when the King came not at his time, they all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded and went away; The King coming over, and finding how it was, fell into deſpair, and ſecretly the next night gets into <hi>Conway</hi> Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> (now Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> by his Fathers Death) ſends the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to the King, that if his Grace would undertake there ſhould be a Parliament called, wherein Juſtice might be done, and himſelf pardoned all Offences, he would be ready to come to him on his knees, and as an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subject to obey him; Yet upon this Conference
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56661:34"/>with the Earl ſome ſay, the King required only, that himſelf and eight more whom he would name, might have honourable allowance, with aſſurance of a private quiet Life, and that then he would reſign his Crown, and that upon the Earls Oath that this ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the King agreed to go with the Earl to meet the Duke, but after four miles riding coming to the place where they had laid an Ambuſh, the King was ſeized, and carried Priſoner to <hi>Flint</hi> Caſtle, where the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> came to him, and bowing the knee thrice came toward him, whom the King took by the hand, and lifted up, ſaying, <hi>Dear Couſin you are welcome,</hi> the Duke humbly thanking him ſaid, <hi>My So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord, and King, the Cauſe of my coming at this preſent is (your honour ſaved) to have reſtitution of my Perſon, my Lands and Heritage;</hi> whereto the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Dear Couſin, I am ready to accompliſh your Will, ſo that you enjoy all that is yours without exception.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this coming out of the Caſtle, the King called for Wine and then mounted on Horſeback, and by eaſie Journeys came to <hi>London,</hi> and the next day he was committed to the Tower. As the King was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried toward <hi>London,</hi> divers Citizens conſpired to lye in wait by the way, and ſuddenly ſlay him, partly for private Grievances, and partly for the Severity, he had uſed toward the whole City; But the Maior hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice thereof, prevented it, and rid forth with a Conſiderable Company to conduct him ſafely to the Tower, and ſoon after a Parliament was called by the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> but in the name of King <hi>Richard,</hi> where many heinous points of Miſgovernment were laid to his Charge, and were drawn up into three and thirty Articles, the Cheif whereof were.</p>

That he had taxed men at the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56661:34"/>pleaſure of himſelf and his unhappy Council, and had ſpent the money in folly and not in paying poor men for their victual and viand. That he ſaid the Laws of the Realm were in his Head, and Breast, by reaſon of which phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical Opinion he deſtroyed Noblemen and Impoveriſhed the Commons; That he moſt Tyranouſly, and unprincely ſaid, that the Lives and Goods of all his Subjects were in his hands and at his diſpoſition; That when divers Lords as well ſpiritual, as Temporal were appointed by Parliament to Treat of matters concerning the good of the Kingdom, while they are buſie therein, he and others of his Party, went about to impeach them of Treaſon; and that the King cauſed all the Rolls and Records to be kept from them contrary to his promiſe made in Parliament, and to his open diſhonour. That he had private Spies in every place, and if any diſcourſed of his Laſcivious living, or his Illegal Actings, he preſently apprehended them, and grievouſly fined them. That he changed Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes of Parliament at his Pleaſure, putting out divers Perſons, and placing others in their Room to ſerve his Will and Appetite. That when divers Lords and Justices were ſworn to ſpeak the truth in many things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the honour and profit of the Realm; the King ſo threatned them that they durst not ſpeak what was right. That by force and threats he compelled the Judges of the Realm to condeſcend to him, for deſtruction of divers of the Lords. That he cauſed his Fathers own Brother, the Duke of</hi> Gloceſter <hi>without Law to be Attached, and ſent to</hi> Callice, <hi>and there without Cauſe to be ſecretly Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That contrary to the Great Charter of</hi> England <hi>he cauſed ſeveral lusty young men to Challenge divers old men, upon matters determinable at Common Law in the Court Martial where Tryal is only by bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which old men fearing ſubmitted themſelves to his mercy, whom he fined unreaſonably at his pleaſure. That in all his Leagues with Forreign Princes, his way of Writing was ſo ſubtill and dark that no other Prince, nor his own Subjects could beleive or trust him; That he craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56661:35"/>deviſed certain private Oaths contrary to Law, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral to ſwear the ſame to the utter undoing of many honest men. That he aſſembled certain</hi> Lancaſhire <hi>and</hi> Cheſhire-men <hi>to make War upon the Lords, and ſuffered them to rob and ſpoil without prohibition; That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his pardon granted them, he inforced divers of thoſe who joined with the Lords to be again Intollerably fined to their utter undoing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon theſe and ſome other Articles which were read it was demanded of the Nobility and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, what they judged both of the Truth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of theſe Articles, who all agreed that the Crimes were Notorious, and King <hi>Richard</hi> was worthy for the ſame to be depoſed from all Princely Honour and Kingly Government. The Duke of <hi>York</hi> who a little before had been Governour of the Realm for the King, and directed him much, thought it beſt, that King <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould both Voluntarily Reſign, and alſo be Solemnly depoſed by conſent of all the States of the Realm, for Reſignation only would be imputed to fear, and deprivation to force; and therefore this being concluded on, there came <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and ſeveral other Lords and Abbots to King <hi>Richard</hi> in the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>

                  <p>When all were ſet in their places, King <hi>Richard</hi> was brought forth apparelled in his Royal Robes, the Crown on his head and the Scepter in his hand, and was placed among them in a Chair of State; Never was Prince ſo Gorgeous with leſs Glory, and greater Grief, to whom it was not diſgrace ſufficient to loſe both the honour and Ornaments of a King, but he muſt openly do even in great ſcorn renounce the one, and deliver up the other.

                  <p>Then he read openly the form of his Reſignation, which diſcharged his Subjects from all Oathes and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, &amp;c. to which the King ſubſcribed, and was ſworn; After which he delivered with his own hands the Crown, the Scepter, and the Robe to the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> wiſhing him more happineſs therewith than ever he enjoyed, deſiring him and the reſt to permit him to live ſafely in a private and obſcure life, and not altogether forget he had been their King.</p>
                  <p>Upon <hi>October</hi> 13. following the Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> was Crowned King by the Name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and King <hi>Richard</hi> was removed to <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle, but ſome of the Lords being diſcontented with <hi>Henry</hi> uſed many endeavours to reſtore <hi>Richard</hi> again, which cauſed great Wars, and Rebellions, and occaſioned ſuch Melancholy in King <hi>Henry,</hi> that ſitting one time at his Table, he ſighing ſaid, <hi>Have</hi> I <hi>no faithful Friend who will deliver me from him that will be my Death.</hi> This Speech was eſpecially noted by one Sir <hi>Piers</hi> of <hi>Exton</hi> who preſently with eight Perſons in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, came to <hi>Pomfret,</hi> commanding the Eſquire who was Taſter to King <hi>Richard</hi> to be ſo no more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the King marvelling, asked him the Reaſon; <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, I <hi>am otherwiſe commanded by Sir</hi> Piers <hi>of</hi> Exton, <hi>who is newly come from King</hi> Henry, when King <hi>Richard</hi> heard that word he took the Carving-knife in his hand, and ſtrook the Eſquire lightly on the head ſaying; <hi>The Devil take</hi> Henry <hi>of</hi> Lancaſter, <hi>and thee

It is ſaid, that at the point of his death the King gathered ſome Spirit and with a faint and feeble voice groaned forth theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Great Grandfnther King</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> II. <hi>was in this manner depoſed, impriſoned and Murdered, by which means my Granfather King</hi> Edward <hi>the</hi> III. <hi>obtained the Crown, and now is the puniſhment of that injnry poured upon his next Succeſſor; well, this may be juſt for me to ſuffer, but not Right for you to do.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Piers</hi> having thus ſlain the King, wept bitterly, and a great part of this prophetical Speech came to paſs in a ſhort time after; King <hi>Richard</hi> thus dead his Body was imbalmed and covered with Lead all ſave his Face, and then brought to <hi>London</hi> where it lay in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church three days unburied, that all might ſee he was dead. And this was the end of this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Prince, in which there was a wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Fortune in behalf of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and againſt <hi>Richard,</hi> but when all is done, there is no reſiſting the Decree of Heaven, but ſince that is unknown to us, and perhaps but Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, we ſhall be manifeſt Traytors to our ſelves if we uſe not our uttermoſt endeavours to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:56661:37"/>it; ſo that it may be truly ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> loſt his Crown more by his own fault, than the Treaſon of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. After this long diverſion let us now return to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In 1458 there were Juſts and Turnaments in the Tower; In 1478. The Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Butt of Malmſey within the Tower; <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Wife to King <hi>Henry</hi> 7. Dyed in the Tower in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed 1502. In the year 1512, the Chappel in the High <hi>White Tower</hi> was burnt; Queen <hi>Ann Bullein</hi> was beheaded in the Tower 1541, and a little after <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine Howard</hi> both Wives to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight. In the year 1546 a ſtrange accident happened in the Tower, for one <hi>Foxly</hi> who was Potmaker for the Mint, falling a ſleep could not be awakened by pinching, beating or burning, for fourteen days; at which time he awaked as freſh as the firſt day he began to ſleep.</p>
                  <p>In King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time, the Tower was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten full of Priſoners, and among others Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> who was kept cloſe Priſoner, and at laſt they took from him all his Books, whereupon he ſhut up his Priſon Windows, and lived in Darkneſs; and being asked the reaſon, he anſwered, <hi>it is time to ſhut up Shop when the Wares are all gone;</hi> At his firſt entrance into the Tower, the Gentleman Porter demanded his Fee, which is the upper Garment, whereupon Sr. <hi>Thomas</hi> pulled off his Cap to give it him, but that not ſufficing, he pulled out an handfull of Angels, and gave him a good many, a Knight that was in his Company tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that he was glad to ſee him have ſo many Angels, <hi>Yes</hi> (anſwered he,) <hi>I love to carry my Friends always about me.</hi> Not long after the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> was beheaded there, and upon the Scaffold, ſhe made a moſt ingenious Speech full of Pity, <hi>That ſhe came thither to ſerve for an Example to Poſterity, that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence cannot be any Protection against Greatneſs; and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56661:37"/>that ſhe was come thither not for aſpiring to a Crown, but for refuſing one when it was offered her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In King <hi>James</hi> his time, there was no Blood ſpilt in the Tower, or upon Towerhill, only Sir <hi>Gervaſe Elways</hi> was hanged there when he was Lieutenant about the Murder of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> and one remarkable paſſage there was in his Speech upon the Ladder, <hi>That being in the Low-Countreys, and much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Gaming, he made a ſerious wiſh that if ever he played more above ſuch a ſum, he might be hanged, but he Violated the Oath, and ſo the just Judgment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fell upon him according to his words.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Castle haven</hi> in the year 1631, was brought from the Tower to be Executed for Horrid Crimes; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others ſince, have been Executed there, as the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and many more.</p>
                  <p>This ſtately Tower ſerves not only for a Goal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Priſoners, but for many other uſes, it is a ſtrong Fort, or Citadel, which ſecures both City and River. It is the Treaſury of the Jewels and Ornaments of the Crown; It conſerves all the Old Records of the Courts of Juſtice at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> it is the place for the Royal Mint, and the Coynage of Gold and Silver, it is the chief Magazine and Armory of the whole Land for Martial Engines and Proviſion, and there only is the <hi>Brahe</hi> or <hi>Rack,</hi> uſually called the Duke of <hi>Exeters</hi> Daughter, becauſe he was the firſt Inventor of it, and Laſtly it is a great Ornament, by the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it, both to the River and City.</p>
                  <p>This City hath had divers other Towns beſides; one at the North End of <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> which is now utterly demoliſhed, and the other at the South End, which hath ſuffered many Accidents of Fireing, and otherwiſe, and was ſtill repaired at the charge of the City. Upon this Gate the Heads of Traytors are commonly placed, and ſome there are thereon at this day. Hiſtorians mention two Caſtles that were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56661:38"/>built in the Weſt part of the City, one called the Caſtle of <hi>Montfiquet,</hi> built by a Lord of that name, which is now demoliſhed, and the <hi>Black Fryers</hi> roſe up inſtead of it, the other called <hi>Baynards Caſtle</hi> from one <hi>Baynard,</hi> whoſe Family long enjoyed it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Robert Fitz-Walter</hi> who was called Banner Bearer of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and had great Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. This Caſtle fell afterwards to the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> who was Crowned there by the Title of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, to whom this City always ſtuck very cloſe, but in the Seventh Year of his Reign many of the greateſt men in <hi>London</hi> were accuſed of High Treaſon, and divers Aldermen, whereof they were acquitted, yet did they forfeit their Goods to the value of Forty Thouſand Marks, and among them Sr. <hi>Thomas Cook</hi> formerly Lord Mayor, without <hi>Hawkins</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower, neither could be diſcharged without paying Eight Thouſand Marks to the King. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh repaired <hi>Baynards Caſtle,</hi> and rid through the City in State with all the Knights of the Garter, from the Tower to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church, where they heard Maſs, and Lodged that Night at <hi>Baynards Castle,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was likewiſe proclaimed at <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards Castle,</hi> though the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a little before.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo another Tower or Caſtle near <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards Caſtle,</hi> but there is now no ſign of it remaining; And another in the place where <hi>Bridewell</hi> now ſtands, which being demoliſhed, yet there was a Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace left where the Kings of <hi>England</hi> kept their Courts, and King <hi>John</hi> ſummoned a Parliament there; and afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight repaired it, and made it much more ſtately for the entertainment of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Charles</hi> the Fift Emperour, and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who in the year 1522 was Magnificently Treated there.</p>
                  <p>There was another Tower called the <hi>Tower Royal,</hi> where King <hi>Stephen</hi> kept his Court; <hi>Barbican</hi> was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56661:38"/>likewiſe another Tower; There was another called <hi>Sernes Tower</hi> in <hi>Bucklersbury,</hi> where we read <hi>Edward</hi> the III. kept his Court, and gave it afterward to his free Chappel of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> now called <hi>Henry</hi> the ſevenths Chappel, who ſpent fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound in building of it, and about the ſame time he built a Great Ship which coſt juſt ſo much. Thus much for the Towers and Caſtles of <hi>London.</hi>

                  <p>This Noble River for its bredth, depth, gentle ſtreight even Courſe, extraordinary wholſom Waters and Tides, is more commodious for Navigation than perhaps any other River in the World; The Sea flows gently up this River fourſcore Miles, that is almoſt to <hi>Kingſton,</hi> twelve miles above <hi>London</hi> by Land, and twenty by Water, bringing the greater Veſſels to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

                  <p>At firſt there was only a Ferry kept where the Bridge now is, and the Ferry-man and his Wife dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, left it to their only Daughter a Maiden named <hi>Mary,</hi> who with the profits thereof, and money left her by her Parents, built a Houſe for Nuns in the place where the Eaſt part of St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi> Church now ſtands, above the Quire where ſhe was buried; and unto thoſe Nuns ſhe bequeathed the benefit, and overſight of the Ferry, but that being afterwards turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Houſe of Prieſts, they built a Bridge of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which they kept in good repair, till at length conſidering the vaſt charge thereof by the contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Citizens and others, a Bridge was built of Stone.</p>
                  <p>Several Accidents have happened concerning this Bridge, of which we ſhall mention ſome hereafter in the Reign of the ſeveral Kings. In the firſt year of King <hi>Stephen</hi> a Fire began near <hi>London-ſtone,</hi> and burnt

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>The Government of the City of</hi> London.</head>
                  <p>THE Civil Government of this City is not as it is in <hi>Rome, Paris, Madrid, Vienna,</hi> and other Cities, by a chief Magiſtrate, or ſome noble Man ſet over it, as it was here in the time of the <hi>Romans,</hi> when the chief Magiſtrate was called the Prefect of <hi>London,</hi> or in the time of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> when he was called the <hi>Portrieve, Cuſtos or Guardian,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Provoſt</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> but after the coming in of the <hi>Normans</hi> the cheif Magiſtrate was called <hi>Bailive</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Commiſſarie,</hi> one that hath a Commiſſion to govern, and there were ſometimes two Bailiffs of <hi>London,</hi> till <hi>Rich.</hi> I. 1189. changed the name of <hi>Bailiff</hi> into <hi>Mayor,</hi> which hath held ever ſince.</p>
                  <p>The Mayor is a Citizen choſen every year by the Citizens, evcept when their Priviledges and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes have been taken from them, as in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> III. <hi>Edward</hi> I. and King <hi>Charles</hi> II. The Mayor, tho' always a Citizen or Tradeſman, hath been of ſuch high repute, that in writing and ſpeaking to him the Title of Lord is prefixt, as to Noble Men, Biſhops or Judges, and of late to the Mayor of <hi>York,</hi> or ſome of the higheſt Officers of the Realm; he is likewiſe uſually Knighted; his Table, (and alſo the two Sheriffs is open to all that are of any Quality, but ſo well furniſhed that it is always fit to receive the greateſt Subject in <hi>England;</hi> nay it is recorded that a Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> feaſted four Kings at once at his Table.</p>
                  <p>His Officers are eight of them Eſquires by their places, that is, the Sword-bearer, the Common Hunt, (who keeps a Kennel of Hounds for the Lord Mayor's Recreation) the Common Cryer, and four Water-Bailiffs; there is alſo the Coroner, three Sergeants
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56661:44"/>Carvers, three Serjeants of the Chamber, a Serjeant of the Channel, four Yeomen of the Water-ſide, one Under Bailiff, two Yeomen of the Chamber, three Meal Weighers, two Yeomen of the Wood Wharfs, moſt of which have their Servants allowed them, and Liveries for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The State of the Lord Mayor appears when he goes abroad, which is uſually on Horſeback, with rich Capariſons, himſelf always in long Robes either of Scarlet richly ſurred. People or Puke with a Chain of Gold about his Neck, many Officers walking before, and on all ſides of him; but eſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At which time, it is ſaid, King <hi>Etheldred</hi> himſelf was in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and had ſummoned a Parliament both of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> to meet there, and afterwards repaired the Ruins the fire had made.

To add to theſe Miſeries a dreadful Sickneſs raged in <hi>London,</hi> and moſt parts of <hi>England,</hi> hitherto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in this Kingdom, being a burning Fever, and the bloody Flux; there was alſo great ſcarcity, by reaſon of the Murrain, and Death of all ſorts of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.

               <p>Soon after King <hi>Etheldred</hi> died alſo, and his third Son called <hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi> (of his enduring Labour) ſucceeded: A great part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> both feared and favoured <hi>Canutus,</hi> eſpecially the Clergy, who at <hi>Southampton</hi> ſwore fealty to him.

               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> being thus diſcomfited, <hi>Edmund</hi> taking advantage of their fear, routed them two days after at <hi>Brainford,</hi> though in paſſing the <hi>Thames</hi> many of his Men were drowned.

And thus was the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchy come to its laſt period, and the totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crown was ſoon after torn from <hi>Edmunds</hi> head: For Duke <hi>Edrick,</hi> a Traitor in grain, being much in favour with both Kings, yet to oblige <hi>Canutus,</hi> contrived the death of renowned <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> who going into a place of caſement, was ſuddenly thruſt from under the Vault into the body with a ſharp Spear; which being done, the Villain <hi>Edrick</hi> cut off his Sovereigns head, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it to <hi>Canutus</hi> with this flattering ſalutation, <hi>All hail thou now ſole Monarch of</hi> England, <hi>for here behold the head of thy Copartner, which for thy ſake I have adventured to cut off.</hi>

                  <hi>Canutus,</hi> though ambitious enough of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, yet being of a Princely temper, he was much aſtoniſhed at this baſe and treacherous Act, and vowed, <hi>That in reward of that Service the Bringers own head ſhould be advanced above all the Peers of his Kingdom.</hi> Which high honour, while this prodigious wretch greedily expected (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for ſome time, ſaith our Author, he had ſome ſhew of favour from the King) he ſuddenly by the Kings command had his head ſtruck off, and placed upon the higheſt Gate of <hi>London,</hi> to overlook that great City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canutus</hi> being poſſeſſed of half the Kingdom by compoſition with <hi>Edmund,</hi> now after his death ſeized the whole, and that all things, as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, might proceed with Juſtice and Concord, he called a Council of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility at <hi>London,</hi> wherein it was demanded, whether in the Agreement between <hi>Edmund</hi> and him, any Claim or Title to the Crown had been reſerved for King <hi>Edmunds</hi> Brethren, or his Sons. The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had paid dear for reſiſting the <hi>Dane</hi> hitherto, and being afraid to provoke him, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely anſwered, <hi>No.</hi> And knowing that Princes are generally appeaſed with flattery, they offered their Swords againſt any ſuch Claims, and took themſelves the Oath of Allegiance to <hi>Canutus,</hi> who being a very wiſe and Politick Prince, had never the better opinion of them for their fawning; rightfully judging, <hi>that thoſe who were falſe to their natural Prince, would never be true to him, nor his poſterity, who were Foreigners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canutus</hi> being thus freed from all his Oppoſites, was Crowned King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> in 1017. by <hi>Elſtane</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> being the ſecond King of <hi>Denmark</hi> of that name, and the firſt of <hi>England,</hi> and the 34.

               <p>After his death the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as <hi>Danes</hi> who had been for <hi>Harold,</hi> thought beſt to ſend for <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyknute</hi> and offer him the Crown; who ſoon after came to <hi>London</hi> in great ſtate, and was there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King of <hi>England,</hi> and crowned. He ſpent his Reign in doing nothing but doing ill.

                  </hi> he having been formerly in that Country. <hi>Harold</hi> was thereupon perſuaded not to venture himſelf in the Battle, but to go on to levy more Souldiers.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56661:69"/>And his Brother told him that <hi>William</hi> charged him that he had taken an Oath to ſettle him in the Throne; and, ſaid he, <hi>Thou knoweſt what Oath thine own mouth hath made unto</hi> William, <hi>if it were lawful, and thou tookeſt it willingly, withdraw thy ſelf out of the Field, leſt for thy great ſin, the whole Army be deſtroyed, for there is no power that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt God.</hi> But <hi>Harold</hi> reproved his Brother for his freedom, and diſdainfully undervalued the ſtrength of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and ſeemed to conceive that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he did being a private man, could now bind him when he was a Prince.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> being now come into the Field, and both Armies facing each other, as ready for Battle; to ſpare the effuſion of Chriſtian bloud, he ſent a Monk as a Mediator for Peace, offering <hi>Harold</hi> either to reſign the Kingdom to himſelf, and acknowledge him his Sovereign, or to trie the quarrel in ſingle Battle, in the ſight of both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: or laſtly, to ſtand to the Arbitrement of the Pope, who ſhould wear the Engliſh Crown. But <hi>Harold</hi> being deſtinated to deſtruction, would neither accept the counſels of his Friends, nor the offers of his Enemies, but referred the deciſion to Heaven, ſaying, <hi>That it ſhould be tried the next day with more Swords than one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next day was the 14 of <hi>October,</hi> which upon a credulous Errour he always held to be fortunate to him, it being his Birth-day, and therefore he greatly deſired to engage in fight. His Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers likewiſe dreaming of nothing but Spoil, and Victory, and that their heads ſhould be crowned with Lawrel, ſpent the preceding night in all manner of Jollity, Banquetting, Revelling, and Noiſe: whereas on the contrary, the <hi>Normans</hi> wiſely and ſeriouſly conſidering the great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the work they were to engage in, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to their Prayers and Vows for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56661:69"/>the ſafety of their Army, and its victorious ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Harold</hi> likewiſe with all expedition marſhalled his Souldiers, placing the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men in the Van (according to an ancient cuſtom) with their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Axes and Halberts, the <hi>Londoners</hi> and the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex</hi> men were in that Squadron which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Brother led.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Normans</hi> advancing forward, diſcharged a fierce Volley of Arrows like a Tempeſtuous Hail, which was a kind of Weapon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> never underſtood, and therefore thought their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had been in the midſt of them already. Soon after the Battle began in earneſt. King <hi>Harold,</hi> like an expert General, had placed his men in ſo firm a Body, that no force of the <hi>Normans</hi> could diſorder their Ranks, till Duke <hi>William</hi> uſed a ſtratagem, commanding his men to ſound a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and counterfeit flight, though he ſtill kept them in good order. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuppoſing the <hi>Normans</hi> to have been fled, and themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Field, careleſly broke their ranks, when ſuddenly the <hi>Normans</hi> came on again, and fell upon them before they could put themſelves in a poſture of defence, whereby multitudes of them were ſlain on every ſide, not being able to make head again.</p>
               <p>Yet did not the <hi>Engliſh</hi> leave the Field, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved rather to maintain their honour in Arms, and caſting themſelves into a Round, they prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red dying for their Country, rather than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Standard of their King, and thereupon encouraging one another, they made reſiſtance for a long time, but ſhowers of Arrows, like a mighty ſtorm, falling among them, one of them moſt fatally, and unhappily for the Engliſh Nation,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56661:70"/>wounded King <hi>Harold</hi> into the Brains through the left Eye; ſo that falling from his Horſe, he was ſlain under his own Standard, and an Ambuſh of Horſemen cut many others to pieces.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> fought ſo valiantly, that he had this day three Horſes ſlain under him, and King <hi>Harold</hi> ſhewed no leſs courage, in killing many <hi>Normans</hi> with his own hands. The Mother of <hi>Harold</hi> named <hi>Thyra,</hi> offered a great ſum of mony for the Kings body, which falling among ſuch a multitude (it being reckoned that there died a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout threeſcore thouſand men that day) it could by no means be found, for it was deſpoiled of all its Royal Ornaments by the plundering Souldiers: ſo that King <hi>Harold</hi> lying ſtript, wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mangled, and gored in his bloud, could not be known from another man, till a Lady named <hi>Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> was ſent for, who for her extraordinary beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was called <hi>Swans Neck;</hi> ſhe having been very familiar with him before he was King, knew ſome ſecret mark in his body, by which ſhe diſcovered him. After which the Duke freely delivered it to his Mother, and it was buried in <hi>Waltham Abby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Battle was fought <hi>October</hi> 14. 1066. a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day of deſtruction to the Engliſh, when the Royal bloud of the <hi>Saxons</hi> periſhed, who firſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided this Land into ſeven Kingdoms, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made of them one glorious Monarchy, not inferiour to any in <hi>Europe;</hi> and whoſe Kings for Valour and Magnanimity, were ranked with the greateſt in the World. But the over-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Heaven, which ſets up and pulls down at pleaſure, was pleaſed at this time, for the ſins of the Engliſh, or ſome other cauſe unknown to us, to put the Scepter into the hands of another Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and another Nation.</p>

               <p>In the year 1235. the 19 of <hi>H.</hi> 3. ſeven <hi>Jews</hi> were brought before the King at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> who had ſtolen a Boy, and kept him private from the ſight of any, but their own Nation for a whole year, and had circumciſed him; intending alſo to have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him at the ſolemnity of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſt before the K. upon which they were convicted, and their bodies and goods remained at the Kings pleaſure. In the 39 of this K. <hi>Nov.</hi> 22. 102 <hi>Jews</hi> were brought from <hi>Lincoln</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there accuſed for crucifying a child of 8 years old, named <hi>Hugh.</hi> Theſe <hi>Jews</hi> were upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſent to the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> the murther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered by the diligent ſearch of the Mother of the child; Upon which eighteen of them were hanged and the other remained long in Priſon.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 2. the number of the <hi>Jews</hi> throughout <hi>England</hi> was very great, yet wherefore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they dwelt, they were commanded not to bury their dead any where but in <hi>London,</hi> which being many times inconvenient to bring dead bodies from remote Places, the K. gave them liberty to bury in the ſame place where they lived. In 1189. at the Coronation of <hi>R.</hi> 1. Son of <hi>H.</hi> 2. at <hi>Westminſter,</hi> a great diſaſter befel the <hi>Jews,</hi> for King <hi>Richard</hi> not favoring them as his Father had done; had given a ſtrict charge that no <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould be ſpectator of the ſolemnity, yet ſeveral <hi>Jews</hi> (as though it had been the Crowning of King <hi>Herod</hi>) would needs be preſſing in; and the Officers appointed refuſing they ſhould enter; there aroſe a Quarrel which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56661:73"/>proceeded from words to blows, whereby many <hi>Jews</hi> were hurt, and ſome ſlain; and thereupon a report was ſuddenly ſpread abroad, that the King had commanded to have all the <hi>Jews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; upon which it is incredible what rifling there was in an inſtant, of the <hi>Jews</hi> Houſes, and cutting their throats, and though the King fignified by publick Declaration, that he was highly diſpleaſed with what was done, yet there was no quieting of the multitude till next day; and many of the Mutineers were afterward puniſhed by the Law.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> 1202. Great ſums of money were exacted, and gathered from the <hi>Jews,</hi> among whom there was one who would not pay the money charged upon him till the King cauſed one of his great Teeth to be pulled out every day for ſeven days together, upon which he was at laſt compelled to give the King Ten Thouſand Marks of ſilver, that no more might, be pulled out ſince he had but one left in his head.</p>
               <p>K. <hi>Henry</hi> 3. being very profuſe, was brought ſo low for want of money that he was forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nay almoſt beg it of his Subjects; but the <hi>Jews</hi> who were ever expoſed to his will, felt the weight of his neceſſities; and one <hi>Abraham a Jew</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> being found a Delinquent, was conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem himſelf for 700 Marks. And <hi>Aaron</hi> another <hi>Jew</hi> proteſted, <hi>the K ſince his laſt being in</hi> France <hi>had taken from him at ſeveral times</hi> 30000 <hi>Marks of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, beſide</hi> 200 <hi>Marks of Gold given to the Queen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At another time this King <hi>Henry</hi> ſqueez'd a ſum out of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then let them out to farm to his brother <hi>Richard,</hi> for a conſiderable ſum which he payd him, and he was to make what more of them he could; He likewiſe built a Church for Converted <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> It happened about this time that a <hi>Jew</hi> fell into an
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56661:73"/>Houſe of Office, upon Saturday, and would not be taken out that day becauſe it was the <hi>Jews</hi> Sabbath; Whereupon the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> ſaid, <hi>He ſhould not then be taken out on the Sunday, becauſe it was the</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath;</hi> So that when Monday came, he was taken out dead.</p>
               <p>In the 7. of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> crucified a Chriſtian Boy upon Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fryday, but did not throughly kill him; for which fact many <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> were, after Eaſter, drawn at the horſe tails, and hanged; The ſame year King <hi>Edward</hi> called in all the old money, and coined new, becauſe it had been much clipped and defaced by the Jews, for which 297 were at one time executed in <hi>London.</hi> And in the eighteenth year of his Reign all the <hi>Jews</hi> were baniſhed out of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> there being at that time above fifteen thouſand in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who had all their Goods ſeized and confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Kings uſe, and onely ſo much money left them as would bear their charges out of the kingdom. But before this he ordained that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould wear a Mark or Cognizance upon their up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Garments, whereby to be known, and reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their exceſſive taking of Uſury.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1656. ſeveral Propoſals were made to <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> by <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael</hi> a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Merchant, in behalf of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation, for their free admiſſion to trade, and exerciſe their Religion in <hi>England;</hi> and a Conference was held about it ſeveral days at <hi>Whitehall</hi> by divers Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council, and certain Miniſters of the moſt eminent then in eſteem, and many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were urged, ſome for, and others againſt their admiſſion; but thoſe that were againſt it, ſo far prevailed, that the Propoſals took no effect.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the <hi>Jews.</hi> To return now to the ſeries of the Story, King <hi>William
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56661:74"/>Rufus</hi> was taxed with great Prodigality, becauſe when his Chamberlain brought him a new pair of Hoſe, he asked what they coſt, and was told three ſhillings: <hi>Away baſe Fellow,</hi> quoth he, <hi>are theſe beſeeming a King? Bring me a pair of a Mark.</hi> His Chamberlain went, and bringing him another pair, not ſo good as the former, and telling him they coſt a Mark, <hi>I marry,</hi> (ſaith the King) <hi>theſe are ſomething like;</hi> and was better ſatisfied with hearing what they coſt, than with ſeeing what they were worth, and yet this was no diſrepute to his wiſdom; for to ſay truth, it is no defect of wiſdom in a King, not to know what his clothes are worth.</p>
               <p>And though the Monks that writ in thoſe times, charge this King with covetouſneſs, yet by the following inſtance it doth not appear. For when two Monks came to Court, and offered large gifts to out-vie each other, in obtaining an Abbots place lately dead, a third Monk, who was very ſober, and mean in attire, came with them and ſtood by; whom the King asked, what he would give to be Abbot: <hi>Nothing</hi> (ſaid the Monk) <hi>for I entered my Profeſſion to be poor, and have hitherto little eſteemed the Pomp and Riches of the World. Then thou art the man</hi> (replied the King) <hi>and art more worthy to he their Abbot for thy Poverty, than they for their Preſents;</hi> and conferring the place upon him, checked the others.</p>
               <p>But however there aroſe a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Anſelm</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> becauſe he required the Biſhop to give him a Thouſand Marks for preferring him to that See, which <hi>Anſelm</hi> refuſed to give, as judging it no leſs Simony to give after the preferment than before; but yet afterward offering five hundred pound, the King refuſed to accept it, as being worth (he ſaid) five times as much. Whereupon <hi>Anſelm</hi> told
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56661:74"/>him, <hi>Your Grace may have me, and all that is mine, to ſerve your turn in a friendly manner; but in the way of ſervitude and bondage, you ſhall neither have me nor mine.</hi> Which-words ſo angred the King, that they could never after be reconciled. And <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm</hi> often threatning to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> the King told him plainly, <hi>He would not thruſt him out of the Realm, but if he would go without his leave, he would keep him out during his pleaſure: and beſides he ſhould carry nothing out of the Kingdom with him.</hi> Yet <hi>Anſelm</hi> ventured it, and the King performed it; for <hi>William Walwerſt</hi> was ſent to rifle him of all he had in his paſſage to Sea; neither was he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to return as long as the King lived: during all which time the King took the Profits of his Biſhoprick to his own uſe.</p>
               <p>This King enlarged the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and compaſſed it with new Walls; he alſo built the great Hall at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being 270 foot in length, and 74 in breadth; but thinking it too little, he intended to have built another Hall, which ſhould have reached from the <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>Kingſtreet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth Year of his Reign, on St. <hi>Lukes</hi> day, ſo great a Tempeſt of Wind happened, that above ſix hundred Houſes in <hi>London</hi> were thrown down therewith, and the Roof of S. <hi>Mary le Bow</hi> Church in Cheapſide was blown off, which with the Beams were carried into the Air a great height, and in the fall ſix of the Beams being 27 foot long, were driven ſo deep into the Ground (the ſtreets not being then paved with ſtone) that not above four foot remained in ſight, and yet ſtood in ſuch rank and order as the Workman had placed them on the Church.</p>
               <p>In the ninth Year of his Reign, a blazing Star ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with two Buſhes or Tails, and other Stars ſeemed to ſhoot darts at each other. The laſt of his Reign, the Sea breaking over its Banks, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56661:75"/>a multitude of People, and overwhelmed the lands ſometime of Earl <hi>Goodwin</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> which are yet called <hi>Goodwins Sands;</hi> There was likewiſe a Well that caſt out bloud inſtead of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for 15 days together, and great flames of fire were ſeen at divers times and places.</p>
               <p>All which Prodigies ſeemed to foretel the Kings death approaching for having kept his Chriſtmas at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> his <hi>Eaſter</hi> at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and his <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> notwithſtanding he was forewarned by many ſigns of ſome great diſaſter, as his own dream the night before, wherein it ſeemed to him that the Veins of his arms were burſt, and abundance of blood ſtreaming on the floor. And of a certain Monk who dreamed that he ſaw the King gnaw the Image of a Crucifix with his Teeth, and that as he was about to bite away the Legs of it, the Crucifix with his feet ſpurn'd him down to the Ground, and that as he lay on the ground there came out of his Mouth a flame of fire with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſmoke; this laſt being told the King, he made a jeſt of it ſaying, <hi>Well a Monk he is, and he can dream only as Monks do, that is for gain, Go, give him an hundred ſhillings, leſt he think he hath dreamed unprofitably.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though he had theſe warnings, yet the day after Lammas he would needs go a hunting in the <hi>New Forreſt,</hi> yet ſomething reſenting the many Preſages, he ſtayd within all the forenoon; About dinner time an Artificer came, and brought him ſix Croſsbow Arrows very ſtrong and ſharp, four whereof he kept himſelf and the other Two he delivered to S. <hi>Walter Tyrell</hi> a Knight of <hi>Normandy</hi> his Bow-bearer; ſaying, <hi>Here Tyrell take you two, for you know how to ſhoot them to purpoſe;</hi> And ſo having at dinner drank more berally than his cuſtom, as it were in contempt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56661:75"/>of Prodigies, and Preſages, he rides out in the <hi>New Foreſt,</hi> where <hi>S. Walter Tyrell</hi> ſhooting at a Deer, the arrow glanced againſt a Tree, or as ſome ſay grazed upon the back of the Deer, and flying forward ſtruck the King in the breaſt, who haſtily breaking off ſo much as ſtuck in his body, with one onely groan fell down, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; of which ſudden miſchance his followers having notice, moſt of them went away and thoſe that remained, with much ado got his body put into a Colliers Cart, which being drawn with one lean Horſe through a very foul dirty way, the Cart broke, and there lay the Spectacle of worldly Glory all beſmeared with his own bloud, and filthyly bedaubed with mire, till he was conveyed to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> where he was buried under a plain Marble ſtone in the Cathedral.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. his brother, and the youngeſt ſon of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour ſucceeded him, though his elder brother <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> was living; which cauſed great Wars, and diſturbance.

                     </gap>m</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> being returned, called a Council of the Biſhops at <hi>London,</hi> wherein he offended both the King and Clergy, for he excommunicated all married Prieſts, half the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> at that time being either married, or the Sons of Married Prieſts; and depending upon the Popes aſſiſtance, he deprived many great Prelats of their Promotions becauſe they were inveſted in them by the King, but they refuſed to reſign them, ſince they had them by the donation of their Soveraign, upon which <hi>Anſelm</hi> thinking himſelf much wronged appealed to the Pope, and went to Rome in Perſon ſoon after.</p>
               <p>The King likewiſe ſent <hi>Herbere</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Litchfield</hi> Privy Counſellors and <hi>William Warwaſt</hi> his Procurator,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56661:76"/>as Ambaſſadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the laſt being a Clergyman of a bold and daring Spirit, He in debating his Soveraigns cauſe before the Pope, and Cardinals, with threatning Language, and Countenance avouched <hi>That the King his Maſter would not loſe</hi> his Right in the <hi>Inveſtitures of the Church though he loſt his Kingdom</hi> Whereto Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> being upon his own dunghill, as ſtoutly anſwered. <hi>If thou ſayeſt the King will not loſe his donation of Churches for the loſs of his Kingdom, Know thou for certain that before God,</hi> I <hi>will not ſuffer him to to enjoy them without puniſhment, and will venture my head thereupon.</hi> But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe great words againſt the King, yet the degraded Abbots were reſtored again through the Clemency of the <hi>Papal See,</hi> which is never wanting to any, as long as <hi>The White and Red make interceſſion for them:</hi> as the Monks own words were at that time.</p>
               <p>A while after Cardinal <hi>Cremenſis</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> from the Pope, and calling a Council in <hi>London</hi> upon the Birth day of the Bleſſed Virgin, he made a ſolemn Oration in praiſe of Virginity and Chaſtity and a terrible Invective againſt the Married Prieſts, affirming it to be no leſs than profeſſed Adultery. And to amplifie their ſin the more, he ſhewed what great Impiety it was to riſe from the Bed of unlawful Luſt (for ſo he ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med chaſt Marriage) and with polluted hands to touch the Sacrament of the Body of Chriſt; yet but the very night following, this holy Cardinal was found in Bed with a common Whore, having himſelf conſecrated the Hoſt that very day; ſo that he returned to <hi>Rome</hi> with much ſhame and but little ſucceſs in the intended matter. Yea, <hi>Anſelm</hi> himſelf, the moſt earneſt in favour of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, did not it ſeems die a Virgin, for elſe he would never in his writings make ſuch lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56661:76"/>for the loſs thereof. Yet <hi>Anſelm</hi> afterward called another Council at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where it was ordained, <hi>That Prieſts ſhould no longer be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to have Wives, and that there ſhould be no more ſelling and buying men in</hi> England; they being then ſold like Horſes or Oxen. Yet King <hi>Henry</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuffered Prieſts to have Wives for Fines, or rather took Fines of them, whether they had Wives or no, becauſe they might have them if they would.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Robert</hi> his Brother having ſound that force would not prevail to ſettle him in his Right to the Kingdom, he himſelf comes over to King <hi>Henry</hi> referring both his Dukedom and himſelf, and all differences and debates to his will and pleaſure; but King <hi>Henry</hi> ſcarce vouchſafed to ſpeak to him, or at leaſt, to make him an anſwer, but in a ſullen humour turned away, and ſo left him. Which ſcornful uſage put the Duke into ſuch Indignation, that he reſolved upon Revenge; and returning into <hi>Normandy</hi> raiſeth a great Army. But <hi>Henry</hi> knowing <hi>Robert</hi> to be a Souldier, and conſidering his own Eſtate, called his Lords toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>London,</hi> and there tickled their cars with this pleaſing Speech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Friends, faithful Counſellors, and Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, You know all undoubtedly, that my Brother</hi> Robert <hi>was elected and called by God himſelf to be the fortunate King of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and how unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, or rather inſolently, he refuſed that ſacred Eſtate, whereby he is now moſt juſtly reprobated of God. You alſo know by many other experiments, his Pride and Arrogancy, for being a man of a war like bumour, he is not onely impatient of Peace, but alſo earneſtly deſireth to trample upon you, as men of object and contemptible diſpoſitions, and upbraid you for idle Drones, Belly-gods, and what not? But I, your King, am naturally inclined to be both humble, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56661:77"/>peaceable, and take delight in nothing more than in doing, you good, and to maintain your Tranquillity, and ancient Liberty (as I have often ſworn unto you) and meekly and willingly to yield my ſelf to your advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereby I may circumſpectly govern you as a cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Prince. And to that end, even now will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm (if your Wiſdoms think fit) your over-worn and undermined Charters, and will corroborate them moſt firmly with a new Oath and Ratification. In the mean time all the Laws which the holy King</hi> Edward, <hi>by Gods inſpiring did eſtabliſh, I do here command to be inviolably obſerved, hereby to move you to adhere ſtedfaſtly unto me, in chearfully, willingly, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repulſing the wrongs offered me; by my Brother ſhall I ſay? Nay, by the moſt deadly Enemy both to me, to you, and the whole Nation. For if I be guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Valour and Affections of</hi> Engliſhmen, I <hi>ſhall ſcorn the threats of him and his</hi> Normans, <hi>and count them vain, and not to be regarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With theſe fair promiſes (which yet he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward quite neglected) he ſo won the hearts of the Lords and the <hi>Londoners,</hi> that they engaged to die with him, or for him, againſt any oppoſition whatſoever. Duke <hi>Robert</hi> being gone, and <hi>Henry</hi> thus ſetled in the affection of the People, he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a very great Army, and, accompanied with divers of the Nobility, ſailed to <hi>Normandy,</hi> where falling upon <hi>Robert</hi> before he was half ready to fight, he obtained a compleat Victory over him, and won <hi>Normandy</hi> with the ſlaughter of ten thouſand men, taking <hi>Robert</hi> himſelf priſoner; whom he brought over and committed to <hi>Cardiff</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Wales,</hi> where he remained a priſoner till he died: yet had liberty of walking in the Kings Meadows and Paſtures. But being weary of this Confinement, he endeavoured to make his eſcape, which the King being afraid of, ordered his eyes to be put out, which to avoid the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56661:77"/>of breaking the Eye-bals, was done by cauſing, his head to be held to a burning Baſin till the Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Tunicles had loſt the Office of retaining the Light</p>
               <p>This, though it increaſed his miſery, yet did not ſhorten his life, for he lived long after; in all, from the time of his Impriſonment, twenty eight years. And thus this great Duke, who in his Birth was the joy of Nature, in his Life was the ſcorn of Fortune. And it is worth obſerving, that the Engliſh won <hi>Normandy</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Robert</hi> died 1134 and lies buried at <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> One Author writes, That King <hi>Henry</hi> ſent him according to his Cuſtom a Robe of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; and putting it firſt on himſelf, found that the Capouch, or Hood, (as the Faſhion was then) was ſomewhat too little; whereupon he ſaid, <hi>Carry this to my Brother, his head is leſs than mine.</hi> The Meſſenger delivering the Robe, Duke <hi>Robert</hi> demanded if any had worn it; and being told the King had firſt tried it on, and what words he had ſaid. The Duke replied, <hi>I have too long protracted a miſerable life, ſince my Brother is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to me, that he ſends me his old Clothes to wear.</hi> And from that time he would never taſte any food, nor receive any comfort.</p>
               <p>This King <hi>Henry</hi> firſt inſtituted the Form of the High Court of Parliament: for before his time, onely certain of the Nobility and Prelates of the Realm were called to conſultation about the moſt important Affairs of State, but he cauſed the Commons alſo to be aſſembled, by Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes of their own electing, and made that Court to conſiſt of three Eſtates, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the Clergy, and the Commons, repreſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Body of the Realm, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56661:78"/>them to fit in ſeveral Chambers; the King, the Lords, and the Biſhops in one, and the Commons in another; and to conſult together by themſelves. He eſtabliſhed likewiſe ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orders, as they are uſed to this day. The firſt Parliament that was ſo held, met at <hi>Salisbury</hi> upon the 19 of <hi>April</hi> in the 16 Year of his Reign, 1019. He forbid wearing of long hair, which at that time was frequent, according to the <hi>French</hi> Mode. He commanded Robers on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to be hanged without Redemption. He puniſhed Counterfeiters of Money with pulling out their eyes, or cutting off their privy members; a puniſhment both leſs than Death, and greater.</p>
               <p>In this Kings time <hi>Guymond</hi> one of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, obſerving that unlearned, and unworthy men were generally prefer'd to the beſt dignities in the Church, as he celebrated Divine Service before him, and was to read theſe words out of S. <hi>James, It rained not upon the earth</hi> III <hi>years and</hi> VI <hi>Months,</hi> he read it thus, It rained not upon the Earth 1.1.1. years, and 5.1. Months; The King obſerved his Reading, and afterwards blamed him for it, but <hi>Guymond</hi> anſwered, <hi>That he did it on purpoſe ſince ſuch Readers were ſconeſt advanced by His Majeſty;</hi> The King ſmiled, and afterwards promoted him. About this time, <hi>Thomas</hi> Archb. of <hi>York</hi> falling ſick, his Phyſicians told him, that nothing would do him good but to company with a woman; to whom he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That the Remedy was worſe than the diſeaſe;</hi> And ſo it is ſaid, died a Virgin.</p>
               <p>Upon the Tenth of <hi>October,</hi> the River of <hi>Medway,</hi> that runs by <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> failed ſo of water for many miles together; that in the midſt of the Channel the ſmalleſt Veſſels could not paſs; and the ſame day alſo in the <hi>Thames,</hi> between the <hi>Tower</hi> and <hi>London</hi> Bridge men waded over on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56661:78"/>foot for the ſpace of two days. A great fire hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>London</hi> which conſumed a long Tract of buildings from <hi>Weſtcheap</hi> to <hi>Aldgate;</hi> and ſeveral other great Cities in <hi>England</hi> were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe burnt down about this time; In the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of this King many Prodigies were ſeen, a Pig was farrowed with a face like a child; a Chicken was hatched with four legs, and the Sun was ſo deeply eclipſed, that by reaſon of the darkneſs, many Stars did plainly appear.</p>
               <p>This King left behind him onely one daughter named <hi>Maud,</hi> who could never come to be Queen, though born to a Kingdom. She was married at ſix years old to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and after his death, ſhe was again married to <hi>Fulk</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> Yet her Father took much care to eſtabliſh the Succeſſion in her and her iſſue, and therefore he called his Nobility together, and among them <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and made them take their Oaths of Allegiance to her, and her Heirs. This he did three years one after another, wherein nothing pleaſed him ſo much, as that <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Blois</hi> was the firſt man that took the Oath, becauſe he was known to be, or it was known at leaſt, that he might be a pretender to the Crown. But the King ſhould have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no Oath is binding when the getting a Kingdom is the price of breaking it, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Stephen</hi> who was ſo deeply intereſted. Yet Providence could do no more, and the King was well ſatisfied with it, eſpecially when he ſaw his daughter Mother of two Sons; for this, though it gave him no aſſurance, yet it gave him aſſured hope to have the Crown perpetuated in his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Yet after King <hi>Henry</hi> was dead, <hi>Stephen</hi> aſcends the Throne, as being Earl of <hi>Bulleign,</hi> Son to <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Beis,</hi> by <hi>Adela</hi> daughter of King
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56661:79"/>
                  <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and though there were two before him, that is, <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, and <hi>Theobald</hi> his elder Brother, yet taking hold of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, while the other lingred about ſmaller Affairs, he ſolicites all the Orders of the Realm, Biſhops, and Lords, and People to receive him for their Sovereign: and ſo upon St. <hi>Stephens</hi> day 1135. he was crowned King at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> and to ingratiate himſelf, be eaſed the People of divers Taxes and Impoſitions. Yet <hi>Stephen</hi> was no ſooner ſet in his Chair of State, but <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> enters <hi>England</hi> with an Army to defend the right of <hi>Maud,</hi> but he was ſoon compounded with, and ſo was <hi>Geoffrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou, Mauds</hi> husband.</p>
               <p>Soon after <hi>Maud</hi> her ſelf comes into <hi>England,</hi> and was received by ſome Perſons for Queen; and <hi>Stephen</hi> hearing that ſome of her Forces had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Lincoln,</hi> goes thither, where his Army was overthrown, and himſelf taken Priſoner, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Maud,</hi> who committed him to <hi>Briſtol</hi> Caſtle. And being fluſht with this ſucceſs, ſhe takes her journey toward <hi>London,</hi> and was there received joyfully, as well as in other places, where <hi>Matilda</hi> wife of King <hi>Stephen</hi> made humble ſuit to her for the Liberty of her Husband, and that he might be ſuffered onely to live a private life. The <hi>Londoners</hi> likewiſe having received her into the City as their Queen, thought now (as Subjects uſually do with new Princes) they might have what they would reaſonably ask; and therefore humbly beſought her, that the ſevere Laws impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them by her Father, might be remitted, and thoſe of King <hi>Edward</hi> might wholly be in force. But ſhe rejected both theſe Petitions, ſome ſay out of Pride, others out of miſtaken Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, as thinking it moſt ſafe to act matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, not upon intreaty but freely, and to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56661:79"/>govern the Subject with ſeverity rather than mildneſs.</p>
               <p>But thoſe harſh and inſulting Anſwers ſhe gave them, were at that time very unſeaſonable, and though they might have been more proper in a ſetled Government, yet in this her green and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable eſtate, they gave a ſtop to the Current of all her Fortunes. For <hi>Matilda</hi> finding by this how high the Empreſſes pulſes beat, ſent to her ſon <hi>Euſtace</hi> to raiſe Forces in <hi>Kent,</hi> ſince their ſuits muſt be onely obtained by the Sword. The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles likewiſe, who ſet up King <hi>Stephen,</hi> finding themſelves ſlighted, and the <hi>Londoners</hi> being as much diſcontented as they, join with them, and contrive how to ſeize upon the Empreſs in the City, and ſo redeem King <hi>Stephen,</hi> to whom their affections were firm. Of which <hi>Maud</hi> having notice, fled ſecretly out of <hi>London</hi> and went to <hi>Oxford;</hi> and from thence ſent ſtrict command that King <hi>Stephen</hi> ſhould be laid in Irons, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly watched, and fed with very mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and ſending to <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> for aſſiſtance, they laid fiege to <hi>Wincheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matilda,</hi> King <hi>Stephens</hi> wife, hearing of this, ſhe with her Son <hi>Euſtace,</hi> and the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Londoners</hi> came preſently to the relief of the place, where a fierce Battle was fought, and <hi>Matilda's</hi> Party prevailed, and the Empreſs <hi>Maud</hi> to make her eſcape, was fain to be laid upon a Horſe back like a dead Corps, and ſo conveyed to <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> But Earl <hi>Robert</hi> her Brother, diſdaining to flie, was taken Priſoner, and uſed more hardly by Queen <hi>Matilda</hi> for her Husband King <hi>Stephens</hi> ſake; but a while after, whether by agreement, or connivance, both <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> alſo made their eſcape out of Priſon.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Stephen</hi> being at liberty, ſeeks out the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, to requite the kindneſs ſhe had ſhe wed him
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56661:80"/>in Priſon, and hearing her to be at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he follows her thither, and lays ſiege to the Town, and brought the Empreſs to ſuch diſtreſs, that ſhe had now no way to ſave her ſelf but by flight. But being a Woman (whoſe Sex hath often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived wiſe men) ſhe reſolved once more to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach her Enemy by Craft, ſince ſhe could not do it by Force. For it being a very cold Winter, the River <hi>Thames</hi> that runs by the Walls of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was very hard frozen, and at the ſame time a deep Snow covered the ground; <hi>Maud</hi> takes the advantage thereof, and clothing her ſelf and four of her company in white linen garments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the eyes of the Centinel, ſhe goes ſecretly in the night out of a Poſtern Gate, and paſſing the frozen River, ran on foot through Ice and Snow, Ditches, and Vallies for five miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till ſhe came to <hi>Abington,</hi> the falling Snow beating in their faces all the way, and there taking Horſe, the ſame night got into <hi>Wallingford</hi> Caſtle. But though <hi>Maud</hi> eſcaped this preſent danger, vet it left ſuch an Impreſſion of fear upon her, that ſhe never after had a mind to appear upon the Stage of War, but left the proſecution of it to her ſon <hi>Henry,</hi> who was now about ſixteen years of Age.</p>
               <p>And not long after, <hi>Euſtace,</hi> King <hi>Stephens</hi> only ſon died, and being left deſtitute of Iſſue to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, he was the more eaſily drawn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace: and ſo it was at laſt concluded that <hi>Stephen</hi> ſhould hold the kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and adopt <hi>Henry</hi> as his Heir to ſucceed him. This Agreement thus made and confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Henry</hi> accounted King <hi>Stephen</hi> ever after as his Father, and <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> as his ſon; and well he might if it be true which ſome write, that <hi>Maud</hi> his Mother, when a Battle was to be fought between King <hi>Stephen</hi> and her ſon, went privately
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56661:80"/>to him, asking him, <hi>How he could find in his heart to fight againſt him that was his own Son? Could he forget the familiarity he had with her in her Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> But however it was, King <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> continued in mutual love and concord, as long as they lived together.</p>
               <p>In the eighth year of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> a Synod was held in <hi>London</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> where it was decreed, that whoſoever ſhould lay violent hands upon any Clergy-man, ſhould not be forgiven, but by the Pope himſelf: and from this time forward, Clergy-men were exempt from the power of the Civil Magiſtrate. In this Kings time there appeared two Children, a Boy and a Girl, clad in Green, in a Stuff unknown, of a ſtrange Language, and of a ſtrange Diet; the Boy being baptized, died ſhortly after, but the Girl lived to be an old Woman: and being asked from whence they were, ſhe anſwered, <hi>They were of the Land of St.</hi> Martin, <hi>where there are Chriſtian Churches erected, but that no Sun did ever riſe unto them: but where that Land is, or how ſhe came hither ſhe her ſelf knew not.</hi> This Story is related by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very credible Hiſtorians, and if true, we may thereby learn, that there are other parts of the World than thoſe which to us are known. In the fifteenth year of this King the River of <hi>Thames</hi> was ſo frozen at <hi>London,</hi> that Horſe and Cart paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over upon the Ice. In his time likewiſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Johannes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>After the death of King <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Anfou</hi> ſucceeded, according to Agreement, by the Title of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, and was crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in the Year 1155. This
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56661:81"/>King had very much vexation from <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> that proud and inſolent Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> a <hi>Londoner</hi> by birth. The King requiring to have it ordained, <hi>That the Clergy who were malefactors, ſhould be tried before the Secular Magiſtrate.</hi> This <hi>Becket</hi> oppoſed it, alledging it was againſt the Liberty of the Church; and therefore againſt the honour of God. Many Biſhops ſtood with the King, and ſome few with <hi>Becket:</hi> the Contention grew long and hot, ſo that the King being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſturbed, ſaid on a time, <hi>Shall I never be at quiet for this Prieſt? If I had any about me that loved me, they would find ſome way or other to rid me of this trouble.</hi> Which complaint four of his Knights that ſtood by, hearing, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and finding <hi>Becket</hi> in the Cathedral, they ſtruck him on the head, and felling him down, killed him in the place. But this created more trouble, for though with much Interceſſion the Pope pardoned the four Knights, being onely enjoined Pennance to go on Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Yet the Kings was more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; for going to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> as ſoon as he came in ſight of <hi>Beckets</hi> Church, alighting off his Horſe, and putting off his Hoſe and <hi>Shoes,</hi> he went bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot to the Tomb; and for a further Penance, ſuffered himſelf to be beaten with rods upon his bare skin, by every Monk in the Cloiſter.</p>
               <p>This King <hi>Henry</hi> firſt ordained that the Lions ſhould be kept in the Tower of <hi>

               </p>
               <p>In the ſixteenth year of his Reign, King <hi>Henry</hi> cauſed his eldeſt ſon <hi>Henry</hi> to be crowned at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Roger</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and cauſed all the Lords to ſwear Allegiance to him, as having found by Experience, <hi>That Oaths for Succeſſion are commonly eluded, but Oaths for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Allegiance can have no evaſion.</hi> At the Feaſt of this Solemnity, King <hi>Henry,</hi> to honour his ſon, would needs carry up the firſt diſh to his Table. Whereupon Archbiſhop <hi>Roger</hi> ſtanding by, and ſaying merrily to the new King, <hi>What an honour is this to you, to have ſuch a Waiter at your Table:</hi> He briskly replied, <hi>Why what a matter is it for him that was but the ſon of a Duke to do ſervice to me that am the ſon of a King and a Queen.</hi> Which the old King hearing, began to repent of what he had done; yet he paſſed it over, and ſet the beſt ſide outward.</p>
               <p>This young King died before his Father, ſo that <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, the eldeſt ſon then living, ſucceeded his Father in the Throne, and was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56661:82"/>crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 1189. He drained great ſums of money from the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and made them recompence in Franchiſes and Liberties. And indeed the Laws and Ordinances in his time were chiefly made for the Meridian of <hi>London.</hi> For whereas before his time the City was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Portgraves,</hi> this King granted them to be governed by two Sheriffs and a Mayor, as it is now. And to give the firſt of theſe Magiſtrates the honour to be remembred, the names of the Sherifts were <hi>Henry Cornhill,</hi> and <hi>Richard Reyner,</hi> and the name of the firſt Lord Mayor was <hi>Henry Fitz-Alwin,</hi> who continued Mayor during his life, which was four and twenty Years. But <hi>Fabian</hi> who was himſelf Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore moſt likely to know the truth, affirmeth, That the Officers ordained now by K. <hi>Rich.</hi> were but only 2 Bailiffs, and that there was no Mayor nor Sheriffs till the tenth of King <hi>John.</hi> But however the City now began firſt to receive the Form and State of a Common-wealth (ſaith the Hiſtorian) and to be divided into Fellowſhips and Corporations, as at this day: and this Priviledge was granted the firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> 1. 1189.</p>
               <p>This King left no Children behind him, that we have any certain account of, unleſs we reckon as a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſt did, who coming to King <hi>Richard</hi> told him, that he had three very wicked Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he deſired him to beſtow, or elſe Gods wrath would attend him. But the King denying he had any Daughters at all, <hi>Yes</hi> (ſaith the Prieſt) <hi>thou cheriſheſt three Daughters, Pride, Covetouſneſs, and Lechery.</hi> The King apprehended his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſmiling thereat, called his Lords attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaid, <hi>My Lords, this Hypocritical Prieſt hath deſcovered, that I maintain three Daughters, Pride, Covetouſneſs, and Lechery, which he would have me beſtow in Marriage; and therefore if I have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56661:82"/>any ſuch, I have found out very fit Husband for them all. My Pride I bequeath to the haughty Templers and Hoſpitallers, who are as proud as</hi> Lucifer <hi>himſelf: my Covetouſneſs I give to the White Monks of the</hi> Ciſtercian <hi>Order, for they covet the Devil and all: but for my Lechery, I can beſtow it no where better than on the Prieſts, and Biſhops of our times, for therein they place their greateſt felicity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Kings time, for three or four years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, there happened ſo great a drougth, that a Quarter of Wheat was ſold for eighteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings eight pence; and thereupon followed ſo great a Mortality of People, that the living ſcarce ſufficed to bury the dead.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> being dead, the Right of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion remained in <hi>Arthur</hi> ſon of <hi>Jeffery</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> elder brother to E. <hi>John;</hi> but <hi>John</hi> thinking <hi>Arthurs</hi> Title but a Criticiſm of State, and not ſo plain to common capacities as his own, who was Son of a King and Brother to a King, aſcended the Throne as confidently as if he had no Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor, onely <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> made an Oration on his behalf, wherein waving the <hi>Right of Succeſſion,</hi> he inſiſted wholly upon the <hi>Right of Election</hi> by the People, whereby it would follow, that thoſe who brought him in, might throw him out. Of which the Biſhop being told, ſaid, <hi>He did it on purpoſe to cauſe King</hi> John <hi>to be more careful of his Government, by making him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible upon what an uncertain foundation his Regality ſtood.</hi> King <hi>John</hi> took notice of this, but ſince it would ſerve his preſent purpoſe, he let it paſs, knowing that his turn once ſerved, he could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward carve out what Title he pleaſed, and ſo upon Aſcenſion day 1199. he was crowned King at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Arthur,</hi> applies
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56661:83"/>her ſelf to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King on behalf of her ſon, who promiſed his aſſiſtance; but yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Peace was made between King <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Lewis.</hi> After which, King <hi>John</hi> being at leiſure, gave himſelf wholly up to pleaſure, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many extravagancies, which ſo far diſobliged ſome of his Lords, that they joined with the <hi>French</hi> King to aſſiſt Prince <hi>Arthur;</hi> but King <hi>John</hi> coming upon them unawares, routed their Forces and took <hi>Arthur</hi> Priſoner, who died ſoon after. The Death of whom, and alſo of <hi>Geoffry Fitz-Peter,</hi> who while the King lived, kept him in ſome awe, left the King at full liberty to his own wild deſires. For at the firſt hearing of <hi>Geoffries</hi> death, he ſwore, <hi>By the Feet of God,</hi> that now at length he was King of <hi>England:</hi> and with great rejoicing ſaid to ſome Lords about him, <hi>Now when this man comes into Hell, let him ſalute the Archbiſhop</hi> Hubert, <hi>whom certainly he ſhall find there.</hi>

               <p>After this the Lords of the Realm having often required their Ancient Rights and Liberties, and finding nothing but deluſions, they would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger endure to be abuſed: but meeting together, they conſider of ſome remedy, and conclude to go to the King themſelves in perſon, and make their demands, producing likewiſe a Charter, which had been granted in <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt's time. Whereupon coming to the King after Chriſtmas, lying then in the New Temple in <hi>London,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with their demands, he anſwers, <hi>That within a few days he will give them ſatisfaction;</hi> and cauſeth the Biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Ely,</hi> and <hi>William Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But the King never intending to do as he ſaid, falls preſently to raiſe Souldiers; which the Lords underſtanding, they all did the like: and going to the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> they deliver
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56661:83"/>him a Copy of their demands, and require the Kings Anſwer; who ſhewed it to the King, with a Meſſage of their Reſolutions, <hi>That if he did not preſently ſeal the Charter then delivered to him, they would compel him thereto with forcible entrance into all his Poſſeſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King being highly offended, asked, <hi>Why they did not alſo require his Kingdom, theſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands being grounded on no colour of Reaſon;</hi> and then ſwore a great Oath, <hi>That be would die before he would enſlave himſelf to them by ſuch Conceſſions.</hi> The Lords by this anſwer knowing what they muſt truſt to, appointed <hi>Robert Fitzwater</hi> to be their General, whom they ſtiled, <hi>The Marſhal of Gods Army, and Holy Church.</hi> Then they beſieged <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Bedford,</hi> and the Governour of the laſt being a Confederate, delivered it up to them. But the <hi>Londoners</hi> diſpleaſed with the King for burthening them with Taxes, not onely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, but invited them to enter the City by night.</p>
               <p>The Lords having now this key of the Land at their diſpoſe, ſent ſuch threatning Letters and Meſſages abroad, that they drew moſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from the King, who being at <hi>Windſor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding an Army; And having notice thereof, and that the <hi>Londoners</hi> were joined with them, he thought good to proceed rather by Fraud than Force; and thereupon ſends to the Lords, <hi>That if they would come to him to</hi> Windſor, <hi>he would grant their demands.</hi> The Lords coming thither, but in a Military manner, for they durſt not truſt his word; the King ſaluted them all kindly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to give them ſatisfaction in all they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And ſo in a Meadow between <hi>Windſor</hi> and <hi>Stanes,</hi> called <hi>Running Mead,</hi> and afterward <hi>Council Mead,</hi> he freely conſented to confirm their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Liberties contained in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and

                  <hi>Charta Foreſtae,</hi> and likewiſe that there ſhould be Twenty five Peers Elected, who ſhould have a ſway in the Government, and whoſe commands all the reſt of the Barons were bound by Oath to obey, and he was contented ſome grave Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages ſhould be choſen to ſee it performed.</p>
               <p>But the next day, when it ſhould be done the King goes privately the night before to <hi>Southam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton.,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi> where adviſing with his Council, It was concluded he ſhould ſend to the Pope to acquaint him with this Mutiny of the Lords, and require his help, while the King in the mean time lived ſkulking up and down in corners that no man might know where to find him, or which is worſe (as ſome write) roving about and Practiſing pyracy. And now the Lords begin to ſuſpect fraud, when ſhortly after the Kings Meſſengers who were <hi>Walter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> return with the Popes Decree, whereby the Barons Charter was by definitive Sentence cancelled and made void, and the King and Barons accurſed, if either of them obſerved the Compoſition. This Decree the King, after he had ſtaid three Moneths in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> coming back to <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> acquaints the Lords with; but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the Meſſenger for falſly informing the Pope, and the Pope alſo for making a Decree without hearing of both ſides, betake themſelves to Arms, and ſwear by the holy Altar to be revenged for this injurious dealing.</p>
               <p>The Ting finding the Lords nothing moved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Popes Decree, ſends again to him, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with it; who being mightily incenſed to have his Decree ſo ſlighted, adjudgeth the Lords to be Enemies of Religion, and gives power to <hi>Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and the Abbot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>The kingdom was now made the Stage of all manner of Rapine and Cruelty, having two Armies in it at once, each of them ſeeking to prey upon the other, and both of them upon the Country.

               </p>
               <p>This he affirmed to be true, as he hoped for the ſalvation of his now departing ſoul, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on counſelling them timely to prevent their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching miſeries; and in the mean while to lock up his words under the Seal of Secreſie, he ſoon after departed this life.</p>
               <p>Theſe dreadful Tidings ſtrangely amazed the Auditors, and though many of the Lords doubted whether if they returned to their Allegiance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward King <hi>John,</hi> he would ever accept of their Repentance, ſince they had ſo highly provoked him.

               <p>But theſe ſolicitors for mercy came too late, for King <hi>John,</hi> through vexation of mind for the loſs of his Carriages, fell into a high Fever, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of within few days he died.

               <p>This King is charged with Irreligion by the Monks of thoſe times, who did not love him, and therefore we know not how far they are to be believed.

In this Kings time likewiſe, five and thirty of the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Citizens were choſen out, and called the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the City.</p>
               <p>In this Kings time there fell Hail as big as Gooſe eggs, with great Thunder and Lightning, ſo that many Men, Women, and Cattle were deſtroyed, Houſes overthrown and burned, and Corn in the Fields beaten down. In 1202. and the 4. of King <hi>John,</hi> there began a Froſt the 14. of <hi>January,</hi> which continued to the 22. of <hi>March,</hi> that the Ground could not be tilled, ſo that in the Summer following a Quarter of Wheat was ſold for a Mark, which in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond was ſold for twelve pence, and a Quarter of Beans or Oats for a Groat; and why the diſproportion in the prices is now ſo great, (ſince the price of Silver is much leſs altered, for an ounce of Silver was then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at twenty pence, which is now valued at five ſhillings) muſt be left to Philoſophers to give the reaſon: for ſince ſcarcity makes things dear, why ſhould not plenty make them cheap?</p>
               <p>About this time Fiſhes of ſtrange ſhape were taken, armed with Helmets and Shields, like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men, onely they were much bigger. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56661:89"/>Monſter was likewiſe found, ſtricken with Lightning not far from <hi>London,</hi> which had an head like an Aſs, a belly like a Man, and all other parts far differing from any other Creature. And in another place, a Fiſh was taken alive in the form of a Man, and was kept ſix Months upon Land with raw fleſh and fiſh, and then becauſe they could not make it ſpeak, they caſt it into the Sea again.</p>
               <p>In the ninth of King <hi>John</hi> the Arches and Stone bridge over the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London</hi> was quite fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by <hi>Serle Mercer,</hi> and <hi>William Alman</hi> then Procurators, and Maſters of the Bridge-houſe: and ſoon after a great Fire happened there, of which you have already an account.</p>
               <p>After the death of King <hi>John,</hi> his eldeſt Son <hi>Henry,</hi> being not above ten years old, ſucceeded him, and was therefore very unfit to govern in ſuch a diſtracted time, when a great part of the kingdom had ſworn Allegiance to Prince <hi>Lewis.</hi> However upon <hi>October</hi> 8. 1216. he was crowned at <hi>Gloceſter</hi> by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, where beſides the uſual Oath taken by all Kings, he did Homage alſo to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> for the kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and promiſed the true payment of the Thouſand Marks a year, which his Father had granted to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then <hi>William Marſhal</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was by general conſent made Protector of the Realm, during the Kings Minority. In the mean time <hi>Lewis,</hi> who thought himſelf ſure of the kingdom by the death of King <hi>John,</hi> now hearing of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Crowning of the young King with ſuch una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent, he begins to grow jealous of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, who indeed had ſome conflicts in their minds whom they ſhould obey; they thought it great ingratitude to forſake Prince
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56661:90"/>
                  <hi>Lewis,</hi> whom they themſelves had invited to come, and yet it ſeemed extream diſloyalty to ſtand in oppoſition to <hi>Henry</hi> their innocent natural Soveraign; but the diſcovery of Viſcount <hi>Melun,</hi> that <hi>Lewis</hi> intended to extirpate all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the curſe of <hi>Wallo</hi> the Popes Legate againſt all who ſhould join with <hi>Lewis,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other reaſons, cauſed the principal of them to ſhrink from <hi>Lewis</hi> and join with King <hi>Henry,</hi> as thinking no obligation ſo great as Allegiance; many others ſtaid with <hi>Lewis,</hi> as thinking none greater than an Oath.</p>
               <p>And now Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> fearing that his enemies having gotten an head, ſhould likewiſe gather a head, and draw more Forces together, ſtaying himſelf in <hi>London,</hi> ſent his Lieutenant with an Army of Twenty thouſand to take in what Towns he could get, ſome of which they took with ſmall reſiſtance; but <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> the Protector, coming againſt them with an Army, utterly routed <hi>Lewis,</hi> and took moſt of the Lords that adhered to him Priſoners; and though his Father <hi>Philip</hi> ſent him more Forces, yet they were defeated at Sea, ſo that <hi>Lewis</hi> upon payment of ſome monies, and other conditions, returned into <hi>France,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> took an Oath, and for him, the Popes Legate <hi>Wallo,</hi> and the Protector, <hi>That he would reſtore to the Barons of the Realm, and other his Subjects, all their Rights and Priviledges for which the diſcord began between the late King and his People.</hi> And afterward he confirmed the two Charters of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta Foreſtae,</hi> granted by his Father King <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Tenth year of King <hi>Henries</hi> Reign, and the nineteenth of his Age, he claimed to take the Government upon himſelf, and no longer to be under a Protector, after which there preſently appeared the difference between a Prince that is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56661:90"/>ruled by good counſel, and one that will do all of his own will, and take no Advice. For thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years he was ruled by a Protector, and then all paſſed as it were in a calm without noiſe, or clamour; but as ſoon as he took upon him the Government, ſtorms and tumults preſently aroſe, neither was there any quietneſs with the Subject, nor himſelf, nothing but Grievances all the long time of his Reign.</p>
               <p>For as ſoon as he was crowned again, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently cancels and annuls the <hi>Charter of the Foreſts,</hi> as granted in his Nonage, and therefore not bound to obſerve it, and then makes a new Seal, forcing all that had Grants by the former, to renew them, whereby he got abundance of money. After which he goes over into <hi>France</hi> to recover his Rights there: to which purpoſe he raiſes great ſums of money from the <hi>Londoners</hi> for Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of their Liberties. About which time <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine Fitz-Arnulf</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> (upon a tumult which aroſe in the City at a Wreſtling, which he purpoſely appointed) endeavoured to ſet up <hi>Lewis</hi> again, and in the heat of the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance he traiterouſly cried out <hi>Mountjoy, Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, God for us and our Lord</hi> Lewis.</p>
               <p>And though the Lord Mayor, who was a very diſcreet perſon, earneſtly perſuaded them to be quiet, yet <hi>Conſtantine</hi> by his ſeditious Orations, had made the people incapable of good counſel; ſo that there was little hope of appeaſing them. The Lord Chief Juſtice having notice hereof, preſently raiſed Forces and entered the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and ſent for the principal men of the City to come before him, who all diſclaimed their being concerned therein, and charged <hi>Fitz Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulph</hi> to be the chief Author thereof. But he reſolutely anſwered, <hi>That he had not done ſo much therein as he ought.</hi> Whereupon he was condemned
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56661:91"/>to die, together with the Crier who publiſhed the Proclamation, and his Nephew; and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed, though when he ſaw the Halter about his neck, he offered Fifteen thouſand Marks for the ſaving of his life. This Execution being done without noiſe, or the knowledge of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> the Lord Chief Juſtice comes into the City, and apprehending ſeveral who where guilty of this Tumult, he cauſeth their hands and feet to be cut off, for a terrour to the reſt, and then ſet them at liberty. The King likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſeveral of the Magiſtrates, but afterwards finding that the baſer ſort of People onely were concerned in the Diſorder, he thereupon was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the City.</p>
               <p>About this time an Execrable Impoſtor was brought before the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who obſerving how eaſily the People were delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in thoſe times of Darkneſs and Superſtition, he impudently cauſed himſelf to be wounded in his hands, feet, and ſides, that by the reſemblance of theſe bloudy Impreſſions, he might be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for their very Saviour: who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon deſervedly immured up between four Walls; and with him a wretched Woman, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of this Chriſt; and ſome ſay another who called her ſelf <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> this puniſhment being thought fitteſt for ſuch Miſcreants, as Monſters too impious, and unworthy to die by Humane hands; though it is very remarkable, that this man ſhould have ſuch a ſevere judgment at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and yet St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who was guilty of the ſame Impoſture, as to the wounds of Chriſt, though not the name, ſhould ſoon after be canonized at <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>chief of Saints;</hi> and perhaps if this Monſter had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had been likewiſe Sainted; and if Saint <hi>Francis</hi> had been at <hi>Oxford</hi> he had been immured.</p>

               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> returning from <hi>France,</hi> brought over many <hi>French</hi> men with him, which he puts in places of Truſt and Profit, and removes and fines his old Officers. The Lords could no longer endure ſo many indignities, to ſee themſelves ſlighted and Strangers advanced, their Perſons likewiſe expoſed to danger, and their Eſtates to ruine, for which they could find no remedy but the Kings confirming their <hi>Charter of Liberties,</hi> wherein it is ſtrange to ſee upon what different grounds the King and the Lords went. It ſeems the King thought, that to confirm their Charter, was to make himſelf leſs than a King; and the Lords thought, as long as that was denied, they were no better than Slaves; and as the King could endure no Diminution, ſo the Lords could endure no Slavery. But the King might keep his own with ſitting ſtill; the Lords could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their own but by motion.</p>
               <p>And hereupon they confederated together, the chief among them being <hi>Richard</hi> the Brother of <hi>William</hi> late Protector, and now Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, who repair to the King and boldly tell him of his faults, and require ſatisfaction. Whereupon the King preſently ſends for whole Legions of <hi>French</hi> men over, and withal ſummons a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whither the Lords refuſe to come.

               <p>Upon this threatning, Pledges are required of the Nobility for ſecuring their Allegiance: and Writs are ſent out to all who held by Knights

                     </gap>t de Burg</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent.</hi> Hereupon the King is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to go himſelf thither; who complained, <hi>That he was not able in regard of his wants,</hi> ſaying, <hi>that his Treaſurers told him, all the Rents of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer would ſcarce maintain him in Clothes, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and Alms.</hi> Whereupon ſome of his Lords anſwered, That he might thank himſelf, if he were poor, ſince he gave ſo much of his Revenue to his Favourites, and had ſo far alienated his Lands, that he was onely a King in name, rather than for his Eſtate; though his Anceſtors were magnificent Princes, who abounded in all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory and wealth, and had heaped up vaſt Treaſures, onely by the Rents and Profits of the Kingdom. The King being ſtung with this juſt Reprehenſion, began by their advice, to call his Sheriffs Bailiffs, and other Officers to a ſtrict account, and ſqueezed great ſums of money out of them, forcing <hi>Ralph Briton</hi> his Lord Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56661:92"/>to pay him a thouſand pound, and others very conſiderable ſums, whereby he at this time filled his Coffers.</p>
               <p>After two years affliction a Parliament is called at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> wherein the Biſhops admoniſh the King, by his Fathers Example to be at peace and unity with his People, and remove from him Strangers, and to govern the Kingdom by Natives of the Realm, and by the Laws, otherwiſe they would proceed by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure both againſt himſelf, and his Counſellors.

               <p>Soon after another Parliament is called, which the King would have to ſit in the <hi>Tower,</hi> whither the Lords refuſing to come, a place of more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is appointed, in which Parliament the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs are removed for corruption; and the King would have taken the Great Seal from the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> who refuſed to deliver it, as having received it from the Common Council of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>In the 21 Year of this Kings Reign another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is called at <hi>London,</hi> where the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great ſum of money, which being directly oppoſed, the King promiſeth by Oath never more to injure the Nobility, ſo they would but relieve him at preſent, and that he would uſe onely the Counſel of his Natural Subjects, and freely grant the inviolable obſervation of their Liberties. Whereupon a Subſidy was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, but with this condition, that four Knights in every County be appointed to receive and pay in the ſame, either to ſome Abby or or Caſtle where it may be ſafely kept, that if the King fail of performing his Oaths and Promiſes,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56661:93"/>it may be reſtored to the Country from whence it was collected.</p>
               <p>About this time the King, to pleaſe the Lords, ordered <hi>Peter de Rivalis</hi> and ſome other of his <hi>French</hi> Favourites, to appear in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> as Delinquents, and he him ſelf coming thither, ſate in perſon upon the Bench among his Judges. And <hi>Peter de Rivalis</hi> being firſt called, the King looking ſternly upon him, ſpake thus to him:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O thou Traitor, by thy wicked advice I was drawn to ſet my Seal to thoſe treacherous Letters for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Earl Marſhal in</hi> Ireland, <hi>the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents whereof, were to me unknown. And by thine, and ſuch like wicked counſel, I baniſhed my natural Subjects, and turned their minds and hearts from me. By the bad counſel of thee and thy Accomplices, I was ſtirred up to make War upon them, to my exceeding loſs, and the diſhonour of my Realm: for thereby I waſted my Treaſure, and loſt many worthy perſons, together with much of my former honour and reſpect. I therefore require of thee an exact account as well of my Treaſure as the Cuſtody of the Wards, together with many other Perquiſites and Profits belonging to the Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom <hi>Rivalis,</hi> denying nothing whereof he was charged, but falling to the ground, thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: <hi>My Sovereign Lord and King, I have been raiſed up and enriched with worldly goods onely by you, confound not therefore your own Creature, but pleaſe to grant me ſome time to make my defence againſt what I am charged with. Thou ſhalt</hi> (ſaid the King) <hi>be carried to the Tower of</hi> London, <hi>there to deliberate of it, till I am ſatisfied.</hi> And he was ſent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But <hi>Stephen de Seagrave</hi> Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, whom the King likewiſe called <hi>moſt wicked Traitor,</hi> had time till <hi>Michaelmas</hi> to make up his accounts, and ſo had others. But afterward by Mediation, and paying very great Fines to the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56661:93"/>King, they obtained their Liberty, and were a while after again taken into grace and favour.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of theſe diſtractions and troubles, it pleaſed God to inflict upon this City, and the Kingdom the Plague of Famine, as well as the Sword, whereby the Poor miſerably periſhed for want of Bread. The Authors of thoſe Times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this Story very credibly, to ſhew how diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Unmercifulneſs and want of Charity is in the ſigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of God. Several poor people plucked the ears of Corn while they were green in the common Fields, meerly to keep themſelves from ſtarving; at which the Owners being much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, deſired the Prieſt of the Pariſh to curſe and excommunicate them all the next Sunday; but one in the Company adjured the Prieſt in the Name of God, to exempt his Corn from the Sentence, ſaying, <hi>That it pleaſed him well that the Poor being pinched with Famine, had taken his Corn;</hi> and ſo commended what was left to the bleſſing of God. The Prieſt being compelled by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the others, had no ſooner begun the Sentence, but a ſudden Tempeſt of Thunder, Lightning, Wind, Hail, and Rain, interrupted him, whereby all the Corn-fields thereabout were laid waſte and deſtroyed, as if they had been trodden under foot with Cart and Horſes; yea, no kind of Fowl nor Beaſt would feed upon it. But this honeſt tender-hearted man found all his Corn and Ground, though mingled among theirs, altogether untouched, and without the leaſt harm.</p>
               <p>Awhile after the K calls another Parl. at <hi>London,</hi> in order to the raiſing of more mony, having tried before to borrow of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and found them to incline to the Lords. To this Parliament the Lords come, armed for their own defence, and make <hi>Richard</hi> the Kings Brother Spokeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56661:94"/>wherein they aggravate his breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſince neither were Strangers removed from about him, but taken more into favour than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Nor was the former money diſpoſed of according to appointment, but the King made bold to make uſe of it at his own pleaſure, the Earl of <hi>Provence</hi> the Young Queens Father, and <hi>Simon Montford,</hi> a new Favourite, and a <hi>French</hi> man born, now made Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> having a good ſhare of the money collected; they acquaint him alſo with all the reſt of the diſorders of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>The King was ſo moved at this their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, that taking his Oath to refer the matter to divers grave men of the kingdom, Articles were drawn, ſealed, and publickly ſet up to the view of all. And ſoon after the Earl of <hi>March</hi> ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the King to make another journey into <hi>France,</hi> whereupon he calls a Parliament at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and demands Aid; which was not onely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but an account required of all the Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hitherto given, with an abſolute denial of any more. Upon which the King comes to the Parliament in Perſon, earneſtly, and indeed hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craving their Aid, for this once. But all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not for they had made a Vow to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and the King is driven to get what he can of particular men, of whom partly by Gift, and partly by Loan, he gets ſo much that he carries over with him thirty Barrels of <hi>Sterling</hi> money. This Expedition had no better ſucceſs than the former; for after a whole years ſtay, the King was forced to make a diſhonourable Truce with the <hi>French,</hi> and upon his return home, he laid new Exactions on the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Londoners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the next Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> enquiry was made how much money the Pope had yearly out of <hi>England;</hi> and it was found to be annually
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56661:94"/>threeſcore thouſand Marks, which was more than the Revenue of the Crown: which the King or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an account to be taken of, and ſent it to the Council at <hi>Lyons.</hi> This ſo vexed the Pope, that he ſaid, <hi>It is time to make an end with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> (with whom he was then at variance) <hi>that we may cruſh theſe petty Kings, for the Dragon once appeaſed or deſtroyed, theſe leſſer Snakes will ſoon be trodden down.</hi> Upon which it was abſolutely ordained, that the Pope ſhould have no more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney out of <hi>England.</hi> But the King being of an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolute and wavering nature, and afraid of Threats, ſoon gave over, and the Pope continued his former Rapine.</p>
               <p>The King had now abundance of Grandees come to ſee him from Foreign parts, and having called a Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> he is ſharply taxed for his Expences, and ſeverely reprehended for his breach of promiſe; having vowed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Charter, never more to injure the State again; alſo for his violent taking up Proviſions of Wax, Silk, Robes, and eſpecially of Wine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of the Seller, and many other Grievances they complain of. All which the King hears patiently, in hope of obtaining Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, which yet they would not give, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Parliament is prorogued till Midſummer following, and the King growing more furious than before, it was then diſſolved in diſcontent. But the Parliament not ſupplying him, he is advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſupply his wants with ſale of his Plate, and Jewels of the Crown, being told, <hi>That though they were ſold, yet they would revert again to him,</hi> And having with great loſs received money for them, he asked who had bought them? Anſwer is made, The City of <hi>London. That City</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible Gulph, if</hi> Octavius <hi>Treaſure were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold, they would ſurely buy it.</hi>

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:56661:95"/>
               <p>In his two and fortieth year another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is held, which by ſome was called <hi>Inſanum Parliamentum,</hi> the Mad Parliament; becauſe at this Parliament the Lords came with great Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of armed men, and many things were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted contrary to the Kings Prerogative. And now to vex the City, the King commands a Fair to be kept at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> forbidding under great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, all exerciſe of Merchandize within <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for fifteen days. But this Novelty came to nothing, for the inconvenience of the place, as it was then, and the foulneſs of the Weather, brought more damage to the Traders than bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> likewiſe he demands New-years<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gifts of the <hi>Londoners;</hi> and ſhortly after writes unto them his Letters, imperiouſly commanding them to aid him with money, and thereby gets twenty thouſand pound of them, for which the next year he craves pardon of them. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his continual taking up of all Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for his houſe without money, yet he leſſens his Houſe-keeping in no honourable manner. Now ſeeing he could get nothing of the States aſſembled in Parliament, he ſends or writes to every No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman in particular, declaring his Poverty, and how he was bound by Charter in a debt of thirty thouſand pound to thoſe of <hi>Burdeaux</hi> and <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coign,</hi> who otherwiſe would not have ſuffered him to come back to <hi>England.</hi> But failing of any relief from the Temporal Lords, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeth his Letters to the Biſhops, of whom he finds as little relief; yet by much importunity and his own preſence, he got an hundred pound of the Abbot of <hi>Ramſey,</hi> but the Abbot of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> had the confidence to deny him, though the King told him, <hi>It was more charity to give money to him, than to a Beggar that went from door to door.</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:56661:95"/>The Abbot of <hi>St. Albans</hi> was yet more kind, and gave him threeſcore Marks; to ſuch lowneſs did did the profuſeneſs of this indigent King bring him.</p>
               <p>But now the Lords aſſemble again at <hi>London,</hi> and preſs him with his promiſe, that the Lord Chief Juſtice, Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Sir <hi>John Manſel,</hi> one of his Council ſpake thus to ſome who was ready to execute his will:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen and Friends, It is not neceſſary for us to put that preſently in execution which the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth in his anger; for it may be when his wrath is over, he will be ſorry for what he hath ſaid. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if any violence be offered to</hi> Bath, <hi>here are his friends ready to revenge it to the utmoſt.</hi> And ſo Sir <hi>Henry Bath</hi> eſcaped the preſent danger, and afterwards with money and friends made his peace.</p>
               <p>About this time the King by Proclamation calls the <hi>Londoners</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there cauſeth the Biſhops of <hi>Worceſter</hi> &amp; <hi>Chicheſter</hi> to declare his intentions, and to exhort the People to undertake
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56661:96"/>the recovery of the <hi>Holy Land</hi> from the <hi>Saracens,</hi> the King being perſuaded thereto by the Pope, who uſually ſent Princes abro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to recover <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi> on purpoſe that he might fleece the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of ſome, and ſeize the Lands of others at home in their abſence.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Londoners</hi> had no mind to this Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and therefore all the Biſhops Arguments prevailed onely upon three poor Knights, whom the King thereupon in open view, embraceth, kiſſeth, and calls his Brethren; but checks the <hi>Londoners</hi> as ignoble Mercenaries, and there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf takes his Oath for performing this Journey, and to ſet forth upon <hi>Midſummer</hi> day next. In taking his Oath he lays his right hand upon his Breſt, according to the manner of a Prieſt; and after on the Book, and kiſt it as a Layman.</p>
               <p>Now for money to carry on this, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a Tenth of the Eſtates of the Clergy and Laiety for three years together. To which end a Parliament is called at <hi>London,</hi> where the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are firſt dealt withal, as being a work of Piety; but they abſolutely refuſe it, then the Temporal Lords are ſet upon, and they anſwer as the Biſhops; which put the King into ſo great a rage, that he drove out all that were in his Chamber, as if he had been mad. Then he falls to perſuade them apart, ſending firſt for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and tells him, how kindly he had formerly been to him; the Biſhop diſſuades him from the Journey by the example of the <hi>French</hi> King, and uſeth many other Arguments; which the King hearing, commanded the Biſhop in great paſſion to be thruſt out of doors, and perceiving by this what he might expect from others, he falls upon his former violent courſes, and the City of <hi>London,</hi> is compelled to contribute a thouſand Marks. <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> is likewiſe ready to revolt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

               <p>After fifteen days conſultation a Tenth is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this holy expedition; and thereupon thoſe often confirmed Charters called <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta de Foreſtae</hi> are again ratified, and that in the moſt ſolemn and ceremonious manner, that State and Religion could poſſibly deviſe. The King with all the chief Nobility of the Realm in their Robes, and the Biſhops in their Veſtments with burning Candles in their hands, aſſemble to hear the terrible Sentence of Excommunication againſt the Infringers of the ſame; and at the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Candles, the King having received one in his hand, gives it to the Prelate that ſtood by, ſaying, <hi>It becomes not me who am no Prieſt to hold this Candle, my heart ſhall be a greater teſtimony;</hi> and withal laid his hand ſpred upon his breſt during the reading the Sentence. Which done, he cauſed the Charter of King <hi>John</hi> his Father, granted by his free Conſent, to be openly read. And then having thrown down their Candles, which lay ſmoaking on the ground, they cried out, <hi>So let them who incur this Sentence be extinct, and have no better ſavour than theſe ſnuffs.</hi> And the King with a loud voice ſaid, <hi>As God help me, I will, as I am a man, a Chriſtian, a Knight, a King crowned and anointed, inviolably obſerve all theſe things.</hi> And therewithal the Bells rung out, and the People ſhouted for Joy.</p>

               <p>The Lords having thus got the Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands, obliege the King to free them from all Obedience and Allegiance whenſoever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed their Charter.

Whereupon the Lords put themſelves into arms, and <hi>Moniford</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> their General, takes many Caſtles. The King likewiſe raiſes Forces. The Barons march toward <hi>London,</hi> under a Banner richly and beautifully flouriſhed with the Kings Arms. And as they paſſed by the Houſes or Poſſeſſions of thoſe that favoured the Popes Bulls (whereby the King himſelf, and all others who had formerly ſworn to obſerve and maintain thoſe new Ordinances and Laws, and to ſupport the Authority of the twenty four Peers, were fully abſolved from their Oaths) they rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and waſted them, as Enemies to the King and kingdom.</p>
               <p>They then approached the City of <hi>London,</hi> and by their Letters deſired the Lord Mayor and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to ſend them word whether they reſolved to ſupport the Authority of the Peers or not; proteſting before God, themſelves intended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; and that if any thing were defective in thoſe Laws, they ſhould be reformed.</p>
               <p>The Lord Mayor ſends theſe Letters with all ſpeed to the King, who deſired likewiſe to know, whether they would ſupport the Laws of the twenty four Peers or not: they ſtoutly anſwered, <hi>that they would, ſince by the Kings command they had all ſworn ſo to do.</hi> The King was extreamly enraged at this anſwer, but he could get no other; and the ſame anſwer they ſent to the Lords, who thereupon proceeded in their march, and were with much joy and kindneſs received into <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſoon after routed the Prince, who came againſt them with a conſiderable Army.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:56661:99"/>
               <p>But ſome of the meaner ſort of the City, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the pretence of theſe diſturbances, to do miſchief, elected two ambitious Fellows, whom they called the two Conſtables of <hi>London;</hi> and agreed, that at the tolling of a great Bell in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, as many as would join with them, ſhould be ready to act whatever the two Conſtables commanded them; and though all endeavours were uſed to prevent them, yet their deſire of plunder ſo furiouſly tranſported them, that upon the tolling that Bell, a great number met together; and marching about eight miles Weſtward from <hi>London,</hi> they ruined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Houſe and Poſſeſſions of the Kings Brother <hi>Richard</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all his Goods with them. Which inſolent outrage much furthered the ſucceeding Wars, for whereas before <hi>Richard</hi> being of a mild and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſpoſition had uſed all his endeavours to make peace upon all occaſions, he now became a profeſſed Enemy both to the Barons, and the City of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this the Lords ſent a Letter to the King, and proteſted with all humility and ſubmiſſion that they intended nothing but the performance of their Oaths, by defending thoſe Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which had been eſtabliſhed in Parliament for the benefit of the King and the Realm. But the King, his Brother <hi>Richard,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the young Prince, thinking nothing more diſdainful than that Subjects ſhould rule and command their Sovereign, reſolved to revenge it, and bid utter defiance to the Lords; and both Armies met near a Town called <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where a cruel Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was fought, and the King, his Brother, and the Prince, were all taken priſoners, with many other great Commanders, and twenty thouſand men ſlain. Yet a while after, upon ſome Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56661:99"/>they were all three ſet at Liberty, and the former Laws and Ordinances were confirmed in Parliament, and the King took an Oath for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the power of the twelve Peers.</p>
               <p>After which the Earls of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the two Generals of the Lords Party, fell into a great difference; which Prince <hi>Edward</hi> taking advantage of, raiſeth an Army, and perſuading the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> to join with him, they fell upon the Earl of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> Army, and utterly routed them, himſelf, his eldeſt Son, and many others being ſlain. Which overthrow utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Barons, and revived the Melancholy King: who calling a Parliament, all the former Decrees were made void, together with the power of the twelve Peers, and the King regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his former Liberty and Authority.</p>
               <p>When this Parliament was ended, the King (perhaps by the inſtigation of his Brother <hi>Richard,</hi> who was ſo horridly abuſed without cauſe, by the baſer ſort of the Inhabitants of the City) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved utterly to deſtroy and conſume the City of <hi>London</hi> by Fire, becauſe he ſaid the Magiſtrates and Inhabitants had always hated him, and taken part with the Lords againſt him. Whereupon thoſe of the Nobility, who were moſt in favour with the King, humbly beſought him, <hi>By no means to do ſuch an execrable deed, which would not onely weaken his own Kingdom and Government, but would likewiſe make him infamous throughout the World to all Generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were very earneſt in their ſuit, and their Reaſons were unanſwerable: yet the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, <hi>That he was reſolved to do it, and his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ſhould be unchangeable, and his Juſtice upon ſuch Rebellious Villains, ſhould be a Preſident to deter all perverſe and obſtinate Rebels and Traitors in time to come.</hi> This ſevere Reſolution made the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56661:100"/>tremble, at the indignation of their angry King; ſo that perceiving his rage and fury not to be mitigated, they cauſed an inſtrument to be drawn in writing, which was confirmed with their Common Seal, wherein they confeſſed their Rebellion, and humbly craved pardon for the ſame; and without any exception or reſervation, they wholly ſubmitted their Lands, Goods, and Lives, together with the whole City, to the Kings Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p>This Inſtrument they ſent to <hi>Windſor</hi> to the King, by ſome of the chiefeſt of the Citizens, who were ordered to preſent it on their knees; but ſo furious was the Kings wrath againſt them, and ſo implacable was his anger, that he reputed none to be his Friends, who interpoſed as Mediators on their behalf: neither would he admit any of them into his preſence, but commanded them immediately to be thrown into priſon, and five of the principal of them he gave to the Prince, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all their Lands and Goods; and all the reſt he beſtowed among his Attendants, who made them Slaves, and ſuffered them to enjoy the leaſt part of their own.</p>
               <p>But when the King had thus a little revenged himſelf, and time had cooled his mighty paſſion, he began to hearken to the importunate interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, and ſoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the City and all its Inhabitants into favour again, and laying onely a Fine upon them of a thouſand Marks, he reſtored to them all their Charters, Liberties, and Cuſtoms, which for their tranſgreſſions he had ſeized into his hands.</p>
               <p>And now though theſe Inteſtine Troubles and Civil Wars, which like an outragious Fire diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the midſt of a well compacted City, had end angered the whole State of the kingdom, were thus appeaſed; and though the Earl of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56661:100"/>by his revolt from the Barons, and joining with the Prince, had greatly furthered this good work, and had cauſed the King to enjoy a happy peace; yet was this Earl ſo little truſted, that he found neither favour nor reward; but was much ſlighted, and had but cold entertainment at Court, which he highly reſented, and meditated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
               <p>In this fury he came headlong into the City of <hi>London,</hi> and complaining of his ill uſage, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people flockt in Troops about him, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly committed many notorious outrages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City, forgetting the great Calamity they had lately ſuffered, and what favours they had received. From thence they went to the Kings Palace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which they moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly rifled, ſpoiled, and ranſacked. This might have produced another Civil War, but the Tumult was in a little time diſperſed, and the Prince again interpoſed himſelf an earneſt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between the King and all the Offenders, and procured a large and free pardon for the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whereby all things were again appeaſed and quieted.</p>
               <p>After which the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> went into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till after the death of his Father.</p>
               <p>It is obſerved of this King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, that he was never conſtant in his love nor his hate; for he never had ſo great a Favourite but he caſt him off with diſgrace, nor ſo great an Enemy whom he received not into favour. An example of both which Qualities was ſeen in his carriage to <hi>Hubert de Burgh,</hi> who was for a time the greateſt Favourite, yet caſt out afterward in miſerable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; and then no man held in greater hatred, yet received afterward into Grace again. And it is ſtrange to read what Crimes this <hi>Hubert</hi> was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56661:101"/>charged with at his Arraignment, and eſpecially one;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That to diſſuade a great Lady from marrying with the King,</hi> he had ſaid, <hi>The King was a ſquint-eyed Fool, and a kind of Leper, deceitful, perjured, more faint-hearted than a Woman, and utterly unfit for any Ladies Company.</hi> For which, and other crimes laid to his charge in the Kings Bench, where the King himſelf was preſent, he was adjudged to have his Lands Confiſcate, and to be deprived of his Title of Earl, yet after all, he was reſtored to his Eſtate again, and ſuffered to live quiet.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe an inſtance of his Timorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the following paſſage. The King being in his Barge on the <hi>Thames,</hi> on a ſudden the Air grew dark, and there followed a terrible Shower with Thunder and Lightning, of which the King being impatient, commanded himſelf to be put to Land at the next Stairs, which was <hi>Durham-houſe,</hi> where <hi>Simon Montford</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> lived; which the Earl having notice of, came to wait on the King, ſaying, <hi>Sir, Why are you afraid, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt is now paſt.</hi> Whereunto the King with a ſtern look, replied, <hi>I fear Thunder and Lightning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, but by the head of God, I fear thee more than all the Thunder and Lightning in the World.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earl anſwered, <hi>My Leige it is injurious and incredible that you ſhould ſtand ſo much in fear of me, who have been always loyal both to you and your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; whereas you ought to fear your Enemies, even thoſe that deſtroy the Realm, and abuſe your Majeſty with bad Counſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Kings Reign the two great Charters of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>Charta de Foreſtae</hi> were rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and confirmed. The Pleas of the Crown were likewiſe pleaded in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> All Wears in the <hi>Thames,</hi> were in this Kings time ordered to be pulled up and deſtroyed. Alſo the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56661:101"/>Citizens of <hi>London</hi> were allowed by Charter to paſs Toll-free through <hi>England,</hi> and to have free liberty of Hunting about <hi>London:</hi> they had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe licence to have and uſe a Common Seal. It was alſo ordained that no Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> ſhould continue in his Office longer than one Year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, whereas before they continued many; and the City were allowed to preſent their Mayor to the Barons of the Exchequer to be ſworn, who before was preſented to the King where-ever he were. In the 32 year of his Reign, the Wharf in <hi>London</hi> called <hi>Queen-Hith</hi> was farmed to the Citizens for fifty pounds a year: which is ſcarce now worth fifteen.</p>
               <p>This King cauſed a Cheſt of Gold to be made for laying up the Reliques of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, in the Church of <hi>Weſtminſter. Hubert de Burgh</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> was buried in the Church of the Friars Preachers in <hi>London;</hi> to which Church he gave his Pallace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which afterward the Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> bought and made it his Inn, then commonly called <hi>York Place,</hi> and now <hi>Whitchall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the thirteenth year of this King, there were great Thunders and Lightnings, which burnt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny houſes, and ſlew both Men and Beaſts. In his 15. year, upon <hi>S. Pauls</hi> day, when <hi>Roger Wiger</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> was at Maſs at <hi>S. Pauls,</hi> the Sky ſuddenly grew dark, and ſuch a terrible Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap ſell upon the Church, that it was ſhaken as if it would have fallen; and ſo great a flaſh of Lightning came out of a dark Cloud, that all the Church ſeemed to be on fire, ſo that all the people ran out of the Church and fell on the ground with aſtoniſhment. In 1233. five Suns were ſeen at one time together: after which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſo great a Dearth, that people were forced to eat Horſe-fleſh, and Barks of Trees: and in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56661:102"/>
                  <hi>London</hi> twenty thouſand were ſtarved for want of Bread.</p>
               <p>In 1236. the River of <hi>Thames</hi> overflowed the Banks, ſo that in the great Pallace at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> men rowed with Boats in the midſt of the Hall. In 1240. many ſtrange Fiſhes came aſhore, and among others forty Sea Bulls, and one of a huge bigneſs paſſed through <hi>London</hi> Bridge unhurt, till he came to the Kings Houſe at <hi>Moreclack,</hi> where he was killed. In 1263. the <hi>Thames</hi> again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Banks about <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and drowned Houſes and Fields for the ſpace of ſix Miles. And the ſame Year there was a Blazing Star ſeen for three Moneths. In 1264. ſeven hundred <hi>Jews</hi> were ſlain in <hi>London,</hi> their Goods ſpoiled, and their Synagogue defaced, becauſe one <hi>Jew</hi> would have forced a Chriſtian to have paid above two pence a Week for the uſe of twenty ſhillings.</p>
               <p>In 1268. there happened a great quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Goldſmiths and Taylors of <hi>London,</hi> which occaſioned much miſchief to be done, and many men were ſlain; for which Riot twelve of the Ringleaders were hanged. In 1269. the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Thames</hi> was ſo hard frozen from the laſt of <hi>November</hi> to <hi>Gandlemas,</hi> that men and Beaſts paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over from <hi>Lambeth</hi> to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and Goods were brought from <hi>Sandwich</hi> and other Port Towns by Land. In 1271. the Steeple of <hi>Bow</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> fell down, and ſlew many people both Men and Women. About the ſame time a Child was born near <hi>London,</hi> who is reported at two years old to have cured all Diſeaſes. And at <hi>Greenwich</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> a Lamb was yeaned which had two perfect bodies, and but one head.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the third died <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. 1272. when he had reigned 56 years and 28 days, and was buried at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> having built a great part of that Church. As ſoon as he was dead, the great
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56661:102"/>Lords of the Realm cauſed his eldeſt Son Prince <hi>Edward</hi> (the firſt of that name) to be proclaimed King; and aſſembling at the <hi>New Temple</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> they there took order for the quiet Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Realm till he came; for he was at this time in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and had been there above a year when his Father died, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med many great Actions; after which, out of Envy to his valour, a deſperate <hi>Saracen,</hi> who had been often imployed to him from their General, being one time upon pretence of ſome ſecret Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage admitted alone into his Chamber, gave him three wounds with a poiſoned knife, two in the Arm, and one near the Armpit, which were thought to be mortal, and perhaps had been ſo, if out of unſpeakable love, the Lady <hi>Eleanor</hi> his wife had not ſuckt out the poiſon of his wounds with her mouth, thereby effecting a Cure, which elſe had been incurable: and it is no wonder that Love ſhould do Wonders, ſince it is it ſelf a Wonder.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Edward</hi> heard of his Fathers death, he took it far more heavily, than he did that of his young Son <hi>Henry,</hi> of whoſe death he had heard a little before, at which when <hi>Chartes</hi> King of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (where he then was) wondered, he anſwered, <hi>He might have more Sons, but he could never have another Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his return to <hi>London,</hi> he was crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter, Auguſt</hi> 15. 1274. and ſoon after called a Parliament, wherein he would admit no Church-men to ſit, And a while after he makes War againſt <hi>Baliol</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> whom he takes priſoner with the loſs of twenty five thouſand <hi>Scots,</hi> and commits him priſoner to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> He likewiſe brings from <hi>Scotland</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Chair wherein the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> uſed to be Crowned, which now ſeems to recover that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56661:103"/>ſecret operation, according to the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>That whitherſoever that Chair ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Kingdom ſhould be removed with it:</hi> and this Chair King <hi>Edward</hi> cauſed to be brought out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to be placed at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Monuments, where it ſtill continues.</p>
               <p>This King reſtored to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> their Liberties, which for ſome miſdemeanours they had forfeited. In the ſixteenth year of his Reign, the Sun was ſo exceeding hot, that many men died with the extremity thereof; and yet Wheat was ſold for three ſhillings four pence a Quarter at <hi>London.</hi> This King by Proclamation forbid the uſe of Sea-coal in <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs,</hi> for avoiding the noiſom Smoak. In his time the Bakers of <hi>London</hi> were firſt drawn upon Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, by <hi>Henry Wallis</hi> Mayor, and Corn was then firſt ſold by weight.</p>
               <p>In a Synod held in his time, it was Ordained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Conſtitution of the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>That no Eccleſiaſtical perſon ſhall have more than one Benefice, with the Cure of Souls.</hi> About this time the new work of the Church at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> was finiſhed; and the Foundation of the <hi>Black-Fryars</hi> near <hi>Ludgate,</hi> was laid by <hi>Kilwarby</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build the Quire of the <hi>Gray Friars</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> now called <hi>Chriſtchurch.</hi> In his time was begun to be made the great Conduit, formerly at the lower end of <hi>Cheapſide.</hi> And <hi>Henry Wall is</hi> Mayor, made the Tun in <hi>Cornhil</hi> a Priſon for Nightwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and likewiſe built a Houſe at the <hi>Stocks Market</hi> for Fiſh and Fleſh, which ſince the fatal Fire in 1666. is demoliſhed and laid into the Street.</p>
               <p>In the ninth year of his Reign, there was ſuch a great Froſt, that five Arches of <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and all <hi>Rocheſter</hi> Bridge was carried down, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56661:103"/>born away. On St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> day in the Even, were great Earthquakes, Lightning, and Thunder, with a great Dragon, and a Blazing Star, which extremely terrified the People. In his two and twentieth year, three men had their right hands cut off for reſcuing a Priſoner from an Officer of the City of <hi>London:</hi> and about that time the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Thames</hi> overflowing the Banks, made a breach at <hi>Redriff</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> and the lower Grounds thereabout were all laid under Water. In his twenty ſeventh year, a Fire being kindled in the leſſer Hall of the Pallace of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the flame thereof being driven by the wind, fired the Monaſtery next adjoyning: which with the Pallace were both conſumed. The ſame year by an Act of Common Council in <hi>London,</hi> with the Kings conſent, it was Ordained, that a fat Cock ſhould be ſold for three half pence, two Pallets for three half pence, a fat Capon for two pence half penny, a Gooſe for four pence, a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard three half pence, a Partridge three half pence, a Pheaſant four pence, a Heron ſix pence, a Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one penny, a Swan three ſhillings, a Crane twelve pence, two Woodcocks three half pence, a fat Lamb from Chriſtmas to Shrovetide ſixteen pence, and all the year after for four pence; and Wheat was this year ſo plentiful, that a Quarter was ſold for ten Groats.</p>
               <p>In his thirty ſecond year <hi>William Wallace,</hi> who had often cauſed great trouble in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was taken and hanged, beheaded, and quartered in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After King <hi>Edward</hi> had reigned thirty four years and ſeven moneths, he died, and was buried at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> leaving his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, called <hi>Carnarvan</hi> to ſucceed him: Of whom the People had at firſt great expectation, but he ſoon brake all his Fathers admonitions, eſpecially that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56661:104"/>he ſhould baniſh for ever <hi>Pierce Gaveſton,</hi> who had been his Companion in many Irregularities in his Youth. He married <hi>Iſabel,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair, of <hi>France,</hi> and makes <hi>Gaveſton</hi> his chiefeſt Favourite; which ſo incenſed the Lords, that they threaten, unleſs he would baniſh him his Court and Kingdom, they would hinder his Coronation. Which he promiſes to do, but doth not perform; but on the contrary, beſtows ſo much of his Treaſury upon him, that he ſcarce left means to ſuſtain himſelf, or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Queen.</p>
               <p>This put the Lords into a new diſcontent, who thereupon went again to the King, and told him plainly, <hi>That unleſs he would put</hi> Gaveſton <hi>out of the Court and Kingdom, they would riſe up in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him as a perjured King.</hi> Whereupon out of fear, the King ſends him to <hi>France,</hi> where finding no entertainment more than in other places, he ſoon returns again, and is received into as much favour as before.

But the King, led by evil Counſel, ſtill refuſed. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lords hearing where he was, ſeized him, and cut off his head.</p>
               <p>The King being much concerned at his death, to vex the Nobility, takes into his neareſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and Council, the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Father, and Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Son, men as debaucht and odious to the Lords and the People, as the other was; for they inclined the King to a lewd and wanton courſe of life among Whores and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, and to forſake the company of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and vertuous Queen, which made him a Scorn to Foreign Princes, and hateful in the ſight
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56661:104"/>of all honeſt men; yet the King, in deſpight of his Lords, ſupported the <hi>Spencers</hi> in whatever they did. Whereupon the Lords riſe in Arms, and the King likewiſe raiſeth Forces, where a great Battle was fought, and the Barons were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and after the Fight, two and twenty of the Lords were beheaded: which increaſed the pride and inſolence of the <hi>Spencers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet the Queen who fled to <hi>Germany,</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returned, accompanied with 300 Knights and ſelect men at Arms, with whom the Lords and the <hi>Londoners</hi> joined; and ſeizing upon the <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> the Father, who was fourſcore and ten years old, was cruelly executed, having his heart pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, and his body left hanging on the Gallows while he was alive; and the Son, with the King himſelf were impriſoned: and ſoon after young <hi>Spencer</hi> was drawn, hanged and quartered, his Head ſet upon <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and his four Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters beſtowed in ſeveral Cities. Then was a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament called, wherein it was agreed to depoſe the King, and ſet up his Son, which he (becauſe they threatned to exclude both him and his Son, and ſet up a King of another Race) conſented to. And thereupon the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and other Commiſſioners, came and ſate at a place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to take his Reſignation, and the King coming forth in mourning Robes, upon a ſudden fell down in a ſwound, and could hardly be recovered.

               </p>
               <p>Whereupon Sir <hi>William Truſſel</hi> Speaker of the Parliament, in the name of the whole kingdom, renounced Homage to the King, in theſe words:</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:56661:105"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> William Truſſel, <hi>in the name of all the Men of the Land of</hi> England, <hi>and of all the Parliament Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator, do reſign to thee</hi> Edward <hi>the Homage that was made to thee ſometimes, and from this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward now following, I defie thee, and deprive thee of all Royal Power, and I ſhall never be tendant to thee as for King, after this time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after, this King was murthered by Sir <hi>John Matravers</hi> and <hi>Thomas Gourney,</hi> by thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hot Spit up his Fundament into his Bowels, after he had reigned nineteen Years and 6 months. 1327. In the eighth year of his reign, was ſo great a Dearth, that Horſes and Dogs were eaten, and Thieves in Priſon pulled in pieces, thoſe that were newly brought in amongſt them, and eat them half alive. Which continuing three years, in the end brought ſuch a Peſtilence, that the living ſcarce ſufficed to bury the dead. In this Kings time, digging the Foundation of a Work about St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> were found above an hundred Heads of Oxen and Kine, which confirmed the opinions, that of old time it had been the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and that there was the Sacrifice of Beaſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> eldeſt Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, by the order of Parliament upon his Fathers Reſignation, was proclaimed King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Jan.</hi> 25. 1327. and ſoon after a Parliament was called, wherein <hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> the Kings Uncle, is accuſed for intending to reſtore his Brother; upon which he was condemned, and brought to the Scaffold, but was ſo generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the People, that he ſtood there from one of the Clock till five in the Afternoon, before any Executioner could be found to do the Office, till at laſt a ſilly Wretch in the Marſhalſey was gotten to cut off his head. But the authors of his death eſcaped not long themſelves: for in the third year of the Kings Reign, another Parliament is holden,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56661:105"/>wherein the Queen hath all her great Jointure taken from her, and is put to her Penſion of a thouſand pound a Year, and her ſelf confined to a Caſtle, where ſhe remained the reſt of her days, no fewer than thirty years. Time long enough to convince her, that her being the daughter of a King, the wife of a King, and the mother of a King, were glorious Titles, but all not worth the Liberty of a mean Eſtate.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> her great Minion and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, lately created Earl of the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> was ſeized on this manner. The King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others with him, went ſecretly one night by Torch-light, through a private way under ground, till they came to the Queens chamber, where lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the King without, ſome of them went in, and found the Queen with <hi>Mortimer</hi> ready to go to bed; and laying hands on him, they brought him out, after whom the Queen followed, crying, <hi>Good Son, good Son, take pity upon the gentle</hi> Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſuſpecting her Son had been amongſt them. This way was taken to apprehend him, to prevent Tumult, he having no leſs than nineſcore Knights and Gentlemen, beſides other meaner Servants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him continually. Being thus ſeized, he is committed to the Tower, and accuſed of divers crimes, and amongſt the reſt, that he had been too familiar with the Queen, by whom ſhe was thought to be with child. Of which Articles he was found guilty, and condemned, and thereupon is drawn and hanged at the common Gallows at the <hi>Elms,</hi> now called <hi>Tyburn,</hi> where his body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained two days an opprobrious ſpectacle to all beholders.</p>
               <p>This King <hi>Edward</hi> the third was a victorious Prince, and with the aſſiſtance of his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> called the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> won many conſiderable Victories againſt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scetch,</hi> taking
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56661:106"/>both their Kings priſoners, who were committed to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> This King inſtituted the Order of the Garter, upon what cauſe is uncertain; the common opinion is, that a Garter of his own Queen, or as ſome ſay, of the Counteſs of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> ſlipping off in a dance, King <hi>Edward</hi> ſtooped and took it up, whereat ſome of his Lords that were preſent ſmiling, as at an amorous action, he ſeriouſly ſaid, <hi>It ſhould not be long ere ſovereign honour were done to that Garter.</hi> Whereupon he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that <hi>French</hi> Motto, <hi>Honi ſoit qui maly penſe, Evil to him that evil thinks,</hi> therein checking his Lords ſiniſter ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>In the fourth year of his Reign the Sea Banks were overflown through all <hi>England,</hi> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the River <hi>Thames,</hi> ſo that all the Cattle and Beaſts near thereunto were drowned. There was likewiſe found a Serpent having two heads, and two faces like a Woman, one face dreſt after the new faſhion, and another like the old, with Wings like a Bat, and men and women periſhed in divers places by Lightning and Thunder; Fiends, Devils, and Apparitions were likewiſe ſeen by men, and ſpoke to them as they travelled. At this time upon the Petition of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> an Act was made that no common Whore ſhould wear any Hood, except ſtriped with divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, nor Furs, but Garments turned the wrong ſide outward. This King confirmed the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and ordained that the L. Mayor ſhould ſit in all places of Judgment within the Liberty of the ſame as chief Juſtice, the Kings perſon only excepted; and that every Alderman that had been Mayor, ſhould be Juſtice of Peace in all <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and every Alderman that had not been Mayor, ſhould be Juſtice of Peace in his own Ward. Alſo he granted to the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> that they ſhould not be forced without
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56661:106"/>their own conſent, to go out of the City to fight, or defend the Land: and likewiſe that after that day, the Charter and Franchiſes of the City ſhould not be ſeized into the Kings hands, but onely for Treaſon and Rebellion done by the whole City. Likewiſe that <hi>Southwark</hi> ſhould be under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City, and the Lord Mayor to chuſe a Bailiff there as he pleaſed. He alſo gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> that the Officers of the Mayor and Sheriffs ſhould from that day forward uſe Maces of ſilver parcel gilt.</p>
               <p>In the twenty ſecond year of his Reign, a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Peſtilence aroſe in the Eaſt and South parts of the World, and coming at laſt into <hi>England,</hi> it ſo waſted the people, that ſcarce the tenth perſon of all ſorts were left alive. There died in <hi>London</hi> (ſome ſay in <hi>Norwich</hi>) between the firſt of <hi>January</hi> and the firſt of <hi>July</hi> 57374 perſons. This Plague laſted nine Years. In the thirty fifth year of his Reign another Plague happened which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſecond Peſtilence; in which died many Lords and Biſhops. In this Kings time a Froſt laſted from the midſt of <hi>September</hi> to the Moneth of <hi>April.</hi> In the fourth year of his Reign a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Juſt or Turnament was held in <hi>Cheapſide, London,</hi> between the great Croſs and the great Conduit. In the eleventh year of his Reign was ſo great plenty, that a Quarter of Wheat was ſold at <hi>London</hi> for 2 <abbr>

But in his 27 year there was a great ſcarcity, by reaſon there fell little or no Rain from the end of <hi>March</hi> to the end of <hi>July,</hi> and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the Dry Summer. <hi>John Barns</hi> Mayor of <hi>London</hi> gave a cheſt with three Locks and a thouſand Marks to be lent to young men upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and for the Uſe of it, if learned, they were to ſay the Pſalm <hi>De Profundis, &amp;c.</hi> for the ſoul of

In the time of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſickneſs the King calls a Parliament at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and demands ſupplies; upon which they demand redreſs of the Grievances of the Subjects, and among the reſt, that <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Law after,</hi> and <hi>Alice Perice</hi> the Kings Concubine, with others, might be removed from the Court; this Woman preſuming ſo much upon the Kings favour, that ſhe grew very inſolent, and intermedled with Courts of Juſtice, and other Offices, where ſhe her ſelf would ſit to countenance her Cauſes. And this was ſo vehemently urged by the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, that the King rather than want Supplies, gave way to it, and ſo they were all preſently put from Court. But the Prince dying ſoon after, they were all recalled to Court again, and reſtored to their former pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> died in the 64 year of his age,

In his thirteenth year, a Royal Juſt or Turnament was proclaimed to be holden in <hi>Smithfield London,</hi> and at the day appointed, about three of the clock in the Afternoon, there iſſued out of the Tower threeſcore fine Horſes apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the Juſts, and upon every one an Eſquire of Honour riding a ſoft pace; after them came four and thirty Ladies of Honour, mounted on Palfreys, and every Lady led a Knight with a chain of gold: Theſe Knights being on the Kings ſide, had their armour and apparel garniſhed with white Harts and Crowns of gold upon their heads, and ſo they came riding through the ſtreets of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Smithfield.</hi> This Juſt laſted twenty four days; all which time the King and Queen lay at the Biſhops Palace by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church, and kept open houſe to all comers.</p>

In the one and wentieth year of his Reign, King <hi>Richard</hi> cauſed the great Hall at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> to be repaired both with Walls, Windows and Roofs. In his twelfth year in <hi>March</hi> there were terrible Winds, and afterward a great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Dearth. A Dolphin was likewiſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at <hi>London</hi> Bridge, being ten foot long, and very big.</p>
               <p>Alſo in Parliament time an Image made by Necromancy in Wax, as it is ſaid, at an hour appointed, uttered theſe words, <hi>The Head ſhall be cut off, the Head ſhall be lifted up aloft, the

In his time a Parliament was called at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in which the Commons preſented a Petition to the King and the Houſe of Peers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that the King might have the Temporal Poſſeſſions of the Biſhops and Clergy; affirming that they would maintain 150 Earls, 1500 Knights, 6200 Eſquires, and 100 Hoſpitals for maimed Souldiers. They deſired likewiſe that Clerks Convict ſhould not be delivered into the Biſhops Priſon, and that the Statute in the ſecond year of his Reign againſt <hi>Lollards,</hi> or the Followers of <hi>John Wickliff</hi> might be repealed. But the King denied their Petition, and in perſon commanded them from thenceforth <hi>not to trouble their brains about any ſuch buſineſs, ſince he was reſolved to leave the Church in as good ſtate as he found it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third year of this King a Blazing Star appeared firſt at the Eaſt, and then ſent out fiery ſtreams toward the North, foreſhewing perhaps the effuſion of bloud that followed after in thoſe parts. In the ſame year the Devil appeared (ſaith our Author) in the likeneſs of a Gray Frier, who entering the Church, put the people in great fear, and the ſame hour the top of the Steeple was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and half the Chancel ſcattered abroad by a Tempeſt of Whirlwind and Thunder. In his eighth year <hi>Richard Whittington</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> erected <hi>Whittington Colledge,</hi> with

The <hi>Grocers</hi> in <hi>London</hi> purchaſed their Hall in <hi>Coney hoop Lane</hi> for 320 Marks. In his twelfth year <hi>Guild-hall</hi> was begun to be rebuilt, and of a little Cottage, made a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Building, as now it is. <hi>John Gover</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Poet, new built a great part of S. <hi>Mary Ove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Church, where he lies buried. In a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden the ninth year of his Reign, the King moved to have allowed him every year, wherein no Parliament met, a Tenth of the Clergy, and a Fifteenth of the Laity; to which demand the Biſhops conſented, but the Commons would not. In his ſeventh year a Parliament began at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> which laſted almoſt a whole year, wherein a Subſidy was granted, which was ſo ſevere, that even Prieſts and Friars who lived of Alms, were forced every one to pay a Noble.</p>
               <p>In the forty ſixth year of his Age, having peace at home and abroad, and being too active to be idle, King <hi>Henry</hi> reſolved to go to the Holy Land, and great proviſion was made for his Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but he needed no ſuch preparations: for being at Prayers at S. <hi>Edwards</hi> Shrine in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Abbey,</hi> he was ſuddenly raken with an Apoplexy, and thereupon removed to the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Weſtminſters</hi> houſe, when recovering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he asked where he was; and being told that it was the Abbots houſe, in a Chamber called <hi>Jeruſalem, Well then</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Lord have mercy upon me, for this is the</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>where an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger told me I ſhould die.</hi> And here he died indeed <hi>March</hi> 20. 1413. aged 46 years; of which he reigned 13.</p>

                  <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth ſucceeded his Father, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a very wiſe and valiant King, though the People much doubted of it, becauſe when he was Prince he followed ſuch diſorderly courſes. For getting into company with ſome lewd Fellows, it is ſaid, he lay in wait for the Receivers of his Fathers Rents, and in the perſon of a Thief, ſet upon them, and Robbed them. Another time when one of his Companions was arraigned for Felony before the Lord Chief Juſtice in <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Hall,</hi> he went to the Kings Bench Bar, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56661:109"/>offered to take the Priſoner away by force, but being withſtood by the Lord Chief Juſtice, he ſtepped to him, and ſtruck him over the Face; whereat the Judge nothing diſturbed, roſe up and told him, <hi>that he did not this affront to him, but to the King his Father, in whoſe place he ſate; and therefore to make him ſenſible of his fault, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him Priſoner to the Fleet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was wonderful how calm the Prince was in his own cauſe, who had been ſo violent in his Companions: for he pariently obeyed the Judges Sentence and ſuffered himſelf quietly to be led to Priſon. This paſſage was very pleaſing to the King his Father, to think he had a Judge of ſuch courage, and a Son of ſuch ſubmiſſion. But yet for theſe and ſome other Frolicks, the King diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed him from being Preſident of the Council, and placed therein his third Son <hi>John.</hi> This made the Prince ſo ſenſible of his Fathers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, that he endeavoured to recover his good opinion, by as ſtrange a way as he loſt it: for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring himſelf in a Garment of blue Sattin, wrought all with Oylet holes of black Silk, the Needle hanging thereto, and about his Arm a thing like a Dogs Collar, ſtudded with SS of Gold, he came to the Court at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> to whom the King, though not well in health, cauſed himſelf to be brought in a Chair into his Privy Chamber, where in the preſence of three or four onely of his Privy Council, he demanded of the Prince the cauſe of his unwonted Habit and coming; who anſwered, <hi>That being not onely his Subject, but his Son, and a Son always ſo tenderly beloved by him, he were worthy of a thouſand deaths, if he ſhould but intend or imagine the leaſt offence to his Majeſty, and had therefore prepared himſelf to be made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi> and thereupon reached his Digger, and holding it by the point he ſaid; <hi>Sir, I deſire not to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56661:110"/>live longer then that I may be thought to be what I am, and ſhall ever be, Your faithful and obedient Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this or the like anſwer, the King was ſo moved, that he fell upon his Sons neck, and with many tears imbracing him, confeſſed, <hi>That his ears had been too open to receive Reports againſt him, and promiſing faithfully, that from thenceforth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſhould cauſe any diſaffection toward him.</hi> But as ſoon as this young King was Crowned at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> he like king <hi>Saul</hi> ſeemed to have a new heart given him, and became another man than he was before. For calling his old Companions and brethren in evil before him, he ſtrictly charged them not to come within Ten miles of the Court till they had given proof of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, And to prevent their proceding in ill courſes, he gave every one of them a ſufficient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
               <p>Immediately after a Parliament was called at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where a Subſidy was granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking, and the Commons began to harp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the old ſtring of taking away the Lands of the Clergy, which the Biſhops, fearing the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, endeavoured to divert, by ſhewing him the great Right he had to the Crown of <hi>France:</hi> which they made ſo plainly appear, that he alters his Arms, and quarters the <hi>Flower de Luces</hi> like the King of <hi>France;</hi> But to do it fairly, he ſends Ambaſſadors <hi>to Charles</hi> the ſixth King of <hi>France,</hi> Requiring him in a Peacable manner to ſurrender the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> The Ambaſſadors had five hundred Horſe to attend them, and were at firſt honourably received and Treated by the Court of <hi>France;</hi> but when their Meſſage was known their Entertainment was ſoon altered and the <hi>Dauphin</hi> (who managed the Affairs of State during the Kings ſickneſs) about this time ſent a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56661:110"/>Tun of Tennis Balls to K. <hi>Henry</hi> in deriſion of his Youth, as fitter to play with them than to manage Arms. Which King <hi>Henry</hi> took in ſuch ſcorn, that he promiſed with an Oath, <hi>It ſhould not be long before he would toſs ſuch iron Balls among them, that the beſt Arms of</hi> France <hi>ſhould not be able to hold a Racket to return them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And accordingly he went with an Army into <hi>France,</hi> and utterly routed the <hi>French</hi> Army at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gincourt,</hi> though they were 6 times as many as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> killing about nine thouſand of them, and taking fifteen hundred priſoners; and on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> part not above ſix hundred were ſlain in all.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his Reign, the followers of <hi>Wickliff</hi> greatly encreaſed, of whom Sir <hi>John Old-Caſtle</hi> was chief, who by marriage came to be Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and in great favour with the King. But being accuſed in a Synod of <hi>London</hi> for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Wickliffs</hi> Doctrine, the King ſent for him, and perſuaded him to ſubmit to the cenſure of the Church; who told the King he onely owed ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Majeſty, and for others, he would ſtand for the Truth againſt them with his life. Upon which he was cited to appear in the Biſhops Court, which he refuſing was condemned by a Synod for an Heretick; in which Synod the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> cauſed it to be ordained, <hi>That the Holy Scriptures ought not to be tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the</hi> Engliſh Tongue. But mark the Judgment of God that fell upon his own Tongue, whoſe roots and blade ſhortly after (as it is recorded) grew ſo big in his mouth and throat, that he could neither ſpeak nor ſwallow down meat, but in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour lay languiſhing, till at laſt ſtarved by Famine, ſo died.</p>
               <p>After this Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle</hi> was taken, and he, Sir <hi>Roger Acton,</hi> and twenty eight more, were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56661:111"/>at S. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, and in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for Hereſie: and all the Priſons in and about <hi>London,</hi> were filled with his Followers.</p>
               <p>In the third year of this Kings Reign, on <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemas</hi> day, ſeven Dolphins came up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> whereof four were taken. This King had ſuch command in <hi>France,</hi> that their own Chronicles teſtifie in the Court of Chancery in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> all things were ſealed with the Seal of King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> In the ſecond year of his Reign, <hi>Moregate</hi> near <hi>Colemanſtreet</hi> was firſt made by <hi>Thomas Fawkener</hi> Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who cauſed the Water of this City to be turned into the <hi>Thames</hi> in <hi>Walbrook,</hi> by making Grates in divers places.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth died the thirty fifth year of his age, and the ninth of his Reign, leaving his Son <hi>Henry</hi> to enjoy his Crown, who was but eight months old when his Father died, yet by the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Regent of <hi>France,</hi> is proclaimed King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and at nine years old was crowned King there, receiving the Oaths and Fealty of all the <hi>French</hi> Nobility.</p>
               <p>This King was very weak in Judgment, and was ruled onely by his Queen, which occaſioned him very great trouble: for they uſed his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the deſtruction of the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and ſeveral other perſons, who were much belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the People. About which time the Duke of <hi>York</hi> began to whiſper his Right to the Crown, as deſcended from <hi>Philippa,</hi> Daughter and Heir to <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Elder Brother to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and Great Grandfather to the preſent King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, and it was privately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſed, <hi>That King</hi> Henry <hi>was of a weak capacity, and eaſily abuſed, and the Queen, who was near to the</hi> French <hi>Queen, was of a malignant ſpirit, and bloudily ambitious, the Privy Council is wiſe enough,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56661:111"/>yet not honeſt enough, regarding more their own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profit than the publick good, and that through their neglect, all</hi> France <hi>was loſt, and that God would not bleſs the uſurped Poſſeſſion of King</hi> Henry. With theſe ſuggeſtions the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men ſeemed to be taken; which being obſerved by an Inſtrument of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> one <hi>Mortimer,</hi> he takes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to tell the People, <hi>That if they will be ruled by him, he will ſhew them the way to make a thorough Reformation, and prevent the Taxes that are upon every ſlight occaſion laid upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe promiſes of Reformation and Freedom, ſo wrought with the People, that they drew to a Head, and make <hi>Mortimer,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> their Leader, who ſtiled himſelf Captain <hi>Mendall:</hi> with whom they came to <hi>Black-heath,</hi> and lay thereabout a Moneth, ſending for whom, and what he pleaſed. He then preſents the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Commons to the Parliament, who ſent them to the Privy Council; but they explode them as frivolous, and charge the Authors to be preſumptuous Rebels: and thereupon the King raiſeth an Army, and brings them to <hi>Greenwich;</hi> but the Lords could get no Followers to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who fought onely for Reformation of Abuſes, and for puniſhment of ſuch Traitors as they ſaid the Lord <hi>Say</hi> was. The Lord <hi>Say</hi> is hereupon committed to the Tower, and the King and Queen retire to <hi>London,</hi> whom <hi>Cade</hi> follows, and comes to <hi>Southwark,</hi> where he Quarters his men; and next morning marcheth to <hi>London</hi> Bridge, where he cauſed his Followers to cut the Rope of the Draw-bridge, no reſiſtance being made againſt him, and ſo in good order marched up to <hi>London-Stone,</hi> upon which he ſtrook his Sword, ſaying, <hi>Now is</hi> Mortimer <hi>Lord of</hi> London. He then ſent for the Lord <hi>Say</hi> out of the Tower, and cut off his head at the Standard in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56661:112"/>and alſo the head of Sir <hi>James Cromer</hi> High-Sheriff of <hi>Kent;</hi> but upon the Kings General Pardon, his Followers leave him, and he is ſoon after ſlain, and with the execution of eight more, though five hundred were found guilty, this Inſurrection is ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>It was a cuſtom that upon St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> day the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> ſhould go to the Wreſtling-place near <hi>More-fields,</hi> where at this time the Prior of St. <hi>Johns</hi> likewiſe was to ſee the ſport; and a Servant of his being aſhamed to be foiled before his Maſter, deſired to Wreſtle again, contrary to cuſtom, which the Lord Mayor denied: whereupon the Prior fetched Bowmen from <hi>Clerkenwel</hi> againſt the Mayor, and ſome ſlaughter was made; the Mayors Cap was ſhot through with an Arrow, yet he would have the ſport go on, but no Wreſtlers came: whereupon he ſaid, <hi>He would ſtay a while to make Trial of the Citizens reſpect to him;</hi> and preſently after a great party of them came with Banners diſplaid, and fetched him home in triumph. Soon after another Quarrel happened in <hi>Holborn</hi> between the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the <hi>Inns of Chancery,</hi> and ſome Citizens, in appeaſing whereof, the Queens Attorney and three more were ſlain. The year after the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices of <hi>London,</hi> upon a very ſlight occaſion fall upon the Foreign Merchants, rifling and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their houſes, but the Lord Mayor by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion appeaſed the Tumult, puniſhing ſome of the Offenders with Death, and others by Fine, and all things are quieted and appeaſed.</p>

               <p>As ſoon as this Parliament was diſſolved, the Duke ſends for the Queen and ſome others, to come out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But they had raiſed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> met them with another; and at <hi>Wakefield Green</hi> the Duke is flain, with the loſs of three thouſand of his men, and leing dead, had his head crowned with a Paper Crown, together with many other Circumſtances
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56661:114"/>of diſgrace. However his Son <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> proſecutes the Quarrel, and puts the Queens Forces to flight, which ſhe endeavoured to recruit; but ſome of her Northern Army ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving robbed the People as they came along the Country, ſaying, <hi>It was their Bargain to have all the Spoil in every place.</hi> The <hi>Londoners</hi> would not ſuffer any Proviſion to be ſent to them, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons riſing about <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> and ſtopping the Carts which the Lord Mayor was ſending to the Army.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Earls of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> having got a conſiderable Army, march to <hi>London,</hi> and were joyfully received there. And ſoon after the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> drawing all his Forces into St. <hi>Johns</hi> Field by <hi>Clerkenwel,</hi> and having caſt them in a Ring, he read to them the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the laſt Parliament, and then demanded, <hi>Whether they would have King</hi> Henry <hi>to reign ſtill?</hi> Who all cryed out, <hi>No, No.</hi> Then he asked them, <hi>Whether they would have the Earl of</hi> March, <hi>Eldeſt Son of the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>(by that Parliament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King) to reign over them.</hi> Who with great ſhouting anſwered, <hi>Yes, Yes.</hi> Then ſeveral Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and others of the City, went to the Earl of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle, to acquaint him what had paſſed; who at firſt ſeemed to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as unable to execute ſo great a charge: but encouraged by the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> he at laft conſented to take it upon him; and ſoon after he was generally proclaimed King. And here Writers end the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, though there were ſeveral changes. For ſometimes he was a King, and ſometimes none, yet he was never well ſetled, though he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved twelve years after.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> was then in the North, and raiſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56661:114"/>an Army to oppoſe <hi>Edward,</hi> but is defeated by the Lord <hi>Falconbridge.</hi> Upon which <hi>Henry</hi> and his Queen go to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and raiſe more Forces, but are again beaten. And now King <hi>Edward</hi> ſits three days together in the Kings Bench in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Hall</hi> to hear Cauſes and regulate Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> is ſent into <hi>France</hi> to treat of a Marriage with that Kings daughter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but in the mean while the King marries the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Gray.</hi> At which <hi>Warwick</hi> grows diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and joins againſt King <hi>Edward,</hi> and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing him, takes him Priſoner, but he ſoon made his eſcape. King <hi>Henry</hi> was taken in diſguiſe and ſent to the Tower of <hi>London</hi> ſome years before. And now <hi>Warwick</hi> going to <hi>France,</hi> brought a great Army over, and proclaimed <hi>Edward</hi> an Uſurper; who thereupon endeavoured to raiſe an Army but could not, and therefore fled out of <hi>England</hi> into the Duke of <hi>Burgundies</hi> Country, and King <hi>Henry</hi> is taken out of Priſon, where he had been nine years, and again proclaimed King.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Edward,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> lands an Army in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and marches towards <hi>London,</hi> where he was joyfully received. And in the year 1471, and the 11 year of his Reign, K. <hi>Edward</hi> made his entry into the City, and had King <hi>Henry</hi> delivered into his hands. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> having notice thereof, marcheth with his Army toward St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi> follows him, carrying King <hi>Henry</hi> along with him; where the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and many others are ſlain, and <hi>Henries</hi> Parry utterly routed.</p>
               <p>And now was the time for King <hi>Henry</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of all his Troubles; for the bloudy Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> entering the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where he ſound King <hi>Henry</hi> nothing at all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56661:115"/>for all his Croſſes, ſtruck him into the heart with his Dagger, and there ſlew him. And now within half a years ſpace, we find one Parliament proclaimed <hi>Edward</hi> an Uſurper, and <hi>Henry</hi> a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King; and another proclaiming <hi>Edward</hi> a lawful King, and <hi>Henry</hi> an Uſurper; that we may know there is nothing certain in humane Affairs, but uncertainty.</p>
               <p>In the fifth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, it rained almoſt continually from <hi>Eaſter</hi> to <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi> In his ſeventh year the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was like to have been drowned paſſing through <hi>London</hi> Bridge, his Barge being ſet upon the Piles ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, that thirty perſons were drowned, and the Duke with others that eſcaped, were fain to be drawn up with Ropes. In his ſeventeenth year was ſo great a Dearth of Corn, that people were glad to make Bread of Fearn roots. Next year all the Lions in the Tower died. In the thirty third year of his Reign, there was a great Blazing Star, and there happened a ſtrange ſight, a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Cock came out of the Sea, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a multitude of people, made a hideous crowing three times, beckening toward the North, South, and Weſt. There were alſo many prodigious Births, and in ſome places it rained bloud.</p>
               <p>About this time the Draw-bridge on <hi>London</hi> Bridge was made, and <hi>Leaden Hall</hi> was built to be a Storehouſe of Grain and Fewel for the poor of the City. In the firſt year of this Kings Reign a Parliament was held at <hi>London,</hi> where the Queen-Mother, with the young King in her lap, came and ſate in the Houſe of Lords. In this Kings Reign Printing was firſt brought into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> by <hi>William Caxton</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Mercer, who firſt practiſed the ſame in the Abby of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> 1471. This King <hi>Henry</hi> loſt his Kingdom
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56661:115"/>when he had reigned thirty eight years ſix months and odd days. The day after he was murdered he was brought to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in an open Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin bare-faced, where he bled; and from thence carried to <hi>Black Fryars,</hi> where he alſo bled, and laſtly was buried at <hi>Windſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth <hi>Walter Walker</hi> Grocer, living in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> was beheaded for ſpeaking ſome words againſt King <hi>Edward.</hi> In his fourth year there was a great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, and the Thames was frozen over. In his 14 year <hi>John Groſe</hi> was burnt on <hi>Tower-hill</hi> for Religion. The ſame year King <hi>Edward</hi> in his Progreſs hunting in Sir <hi>Thomas Burdels</hi> Park, ſlew many Deer, and among the reſt a white Buck, which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hearing of, wiſhed <hi>the Bucks head, horns and all in his belly who moved the King to kill him.</hi> Upon which words he was condemned to die, and being drawn from the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> was there beheaded. Next year <hi>George</hi> D. of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> K. <hi>Ed.</hi> Brother, was drowned in the Tower in a But of Malmſey. In his twenty ſecond year ſome Thieves for Robbery in St. <hi>Martins le Grand,</hi> were drawn to <hi>Tower-hill</hi> and there hanged and burnt, and others were preſſed to death.</p>
               <p>In this Kings time <hi>Richard Rawſon,</hi> one of the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> cauſed a Houſe to be built at St. <hi>Mary Spittle</hi> for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen to hear Sermons in the Eaſter Holy-days.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth being dead, his eldeſt Son <hi>Edward,</hi> not above eleven years old, was proclaimed King, but never crowned; for the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> hearing of his Brothers death, comes to <hi>London,</hi> and having gotten the King and his Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> into his hands, ſends them to the Tower, and murders the Lord <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> who was true to <hi>Edward,</hi> and then endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove the two children of <hi>Edward</hi> Illegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56661:116"/>whereby he at laſt attained the Crown by the name of <hi>Richard</hi> the third, and afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades Sir <hi>James Tyril</hi> to murder the two young Princes in the <hi>Tower,</hi> who getting two other Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains as bad as himſelf, they come to the childrens chamber in the night, and ſuddenly wrapping them up in their cloths, and keeping down by force the Feather-bed and Pillows hard upon their mouths, ſo ſtifled them that their breath being gone, they ſurrendred up their innocent ſouls; and when the Murtherers perceived firſt by their ſtrugling with the pains of death, and then by their long lying ſtill, that they were throughly dead, they laid their bodies out, and then called Sir <hi>James Tyril</hi> to ſee them, who preſently cauſed their bodies to be buried under the Stairs. But theſe Murderers came all to miſerable ends; and King <hi>Richard</hi> himſelf, after this abominable Fact, never had a quiet mind, but was troubled with fearful dreams, and would ſometimes ſtart out of his bed and run about the chamber in a great fright, as if all the Furies in Hell were about him, as he did the night before the Battle at <hi>Boſworth</hi> Field, where he was ſlain by King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, who ſucceeded to the Crown.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> took away from <hi>Jane Shore</hi> one of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Concubines, all her Goods, to the value of above 3000 Marks; and afterward cauſed her to do Pennance before the Croſs for her Incontinency, with a Taper in her hand: when, though undreſſed, yet ſhe appeared ſo fair, and lovely, and likewiſe ſo modeſt, that many who hated her courſe of life, yet pitied her courſe uſage, ſince ſhe uſed all the favour ſhe had with King <hi>Edward</hi> to the good of many, but never to the hurt of any. And truly ſhe had cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt <hi>Richard</hi> for being ſo ſevere for her offending againſt the ſeventh Commandment

               <p>After <hi>Richard</hi> (called <hi>Crook-back</hi>) was ſlain, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh was proclaimed King.

In her thirty fifth year there was ſo great a drougth, that not only the Fields but the Springs themſelves were dried up, and many Cattle died every where for want of water.

               <p>About this time <hi>Edmund Coppinger</hi> and <hi>Henry Arthington</hi> Gentlemen, came into <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and there in a Cart proclaimed (as they ſaid) News from Heaven, that one <hi>William Hacket</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt, by partaking of his glorified Body, and that they were the two Prophets, one of Mercy, the other of Judgment, ſent of God to help him in this great work. Theſe men were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and <hi>Hacket</hi> was arraigned, and found guilty of ſpeaking divers falſe and traiterous words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queen, and to have raced and defaced her Pictures, thruſting an iron Inſtrument into the place of the heart and breſt; for which he was brought from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and being moved to ask God and their Queen forgiveneſs, he fell to curſing and railing againſt the Queen, and made a blaſphemous Prayer againſt the divine Majeſty of God, and was therefore hanged and quartered. <hi>Coppinger</hi> ſtarved himſelf wilfully in <hi>Bridewel,</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> made a Recantation.</p>

               <p>After her death King <hi>James</hi> ſucceeded, in the third year of whoſe Reign, was contrived the Powder Treaſon Plot, for which Sir <hi>Edward Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, Robert Winter, Graunt,</hi> and <hi>Bates</hi> were drawn, hanged, and quartered at the Weſt end of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Winter, Keys, Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Fawks,</hi> at the Parliament Yard at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> A while after, the King attended with divers Lords, dined with the Lord Mayor Sir <hi>John Watts,</hi> who after dinner preſented his Majeſty with a Purſe of Gold, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he would pleaſe to be made Free of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Clothworkers,</hi> to which the King conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and calling to the Maſter of the Company, he ſaid, Stone, <hi>Give me thy hand, I am now a Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker, and in token of my ſpecial favour to this Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, I do here give to this Company a Brace of Bueks yearly for ever, at the Election of Maſter and Wardens.</hi> And a Moneth after the King and the Prince dined at <hi>Merchant Taylors</hi> Hall, where the Prince was made Free of that Company, and had
