            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AN Ingenious Hi≈øtorian who was a great Traveller, writing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this famous City about Thirty years ≈øince, ventured to compare it as to Scituation, Government, Trade, Arti≈øts, and all other Accommodations to the greate≈øt Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> yea all things con≈øidered, to the Greatest in the World, and if at that time it de≈øerved ≈øuch high <hi>Encomiums,</hi> then certainly ≈øince its Ri≈øe out of tho≈øe Ruines that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily befell a great part thereof by the dreadful fire in <hi>1666,</hi> it doth even excel it ≈øelf; and the Beauty thereof is very much increa≈øed, e≈øpecially as to <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Curio≈øity of Buildings, largene≈øs of Streets, and many other Excellencies which that fiery Purgation hath occa≈øioned; So that we may invert what was formerly ≈øaid of <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple in <hi>Ezra's</hi> time, <hi>That the Glory of the former City is
<pb facs="tcp:56661:3"/>not to be compared with the Glory of the latter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There needs then no Apology for making this ≈øhort Collection concerning this great Subject, e≈øpecially ≈øince there are few Books now extant that Treat of the Antiquities thereof, and none that I know of, who have written of the particular Accidents that happened thereunto; It cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be unacceptable to have a ≈øhort Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual of ≈øo many particulars, for ≈øo long time pa≈øt at ≈øo ≈ømall a price as this is, The ≈øerious peru≈øal whereof will very much confirm the Truth of what the wi≈øe <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> writ ≈øo long ≈øince, Eccl. <hi>1.9. The thing that hath been, it is that which ≈øhall be, and that which is done is that which ≈øhall be done, and there is no new thing under the Sun.</hi>

                  <p>THough it may ≈øeem difficult to di≈øcover the Original of ≈øome Nations and Cities, yet it is no hard matter to find out the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Honourable and Famous City of <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers to magnify the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> drew its Original from Gods, and Demy-Gods, by the race of the <hi>Trojans,</hi> ≈øo <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> our <hi>Wel≈øh</hi> Hi≈øtorian, for the greater Glory of this Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed City, deduceth it from the ≈øame Original, relating that <hi>Bruce</hi> who de≈øcended from the Demy-God <hi>Aeneas,</hi> the Son of <hi>Venus,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> about the year of the World 2855, and 1108 years before the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our ble≈ø≈øed Saviour built this City near the River now called <hi>Thames,</hi> and named it <hi>Troynovant,</hi> or <hi>Trenovant;</hi> but this Account has no great Authority.</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:56661:4"/>
                  <p>The ≈øame Hi≈øtorian tells us, that K. <hi>Lud</hi> afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired and increa≈øed this City with fair Buildings, Towers, and Walls, and called it after his own name <hi>Caire Lud</hi> or <hi>Luds</hi> Town, and the Gate which he built in the We≈øt part thereof, he likewi≈øe for his own Honour named <hi>Ludgate.</hi> He adds, That this <hi>Lud</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Androgeus</hi> and <hi>Theomantius,</hi> who being not of Age to Govern at the Death of their Father, their Uncle <hi>Ca≈ø≈øibelan</hi> took upon him the Crown; in the eight year of who≈øe Reign, <hi>Julius Cae≈øar</hi> arrived in <hi>England</hi> with a formidable Army to Conquer it, and obliged the <hi>Brittains</hi> to pay a yearly Tribute to <hi>Rome. Cae≈øar</hi> calls <hi>London</hi> the City of the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> which ≈øounds ≈øomewhat like <hi>Troy Nova,</hi> though learned men think that <hi>Trinobantes</hi> ≈øignifies the State or Signiory of the <hi>Trinobantes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in tho≈øe dayes, the Cities of the <hi>Brittains</hi> were not artificially built with Stone or Timber, but were only thick, and Trouble≈øome Woods pla≈øhed together, and intrenched round, like to tho≈øe which the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> at this day call <hi>Fa≈øtne≈ø≈øes;</hi> Some are of Opinion that whence <hi>London</hi> had her Fame, from thence ≈øhe had al≈øo a Name, that is from Ships, which the <hi>Brittains</hi> call <hi>Lough,</hi> and <hi>Dinan</hi> a Town, ≈øo that <hi>London</hi> is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Shipton,</hi> a Town of Ships; which Title no City hath more Right to a≈ø≈øume than this, being ≈øcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated upon the gentle A≈øcent of an Hill, near a gallant Navigable River, which ≈øwelling at certain times with the Ocean Tides, ≈øhe is able by her deep and ≈øafe Channel to entertain the greate≈øt Ships, which bring in all the riche≈øt Commodities the World can afford.</p>
                  <p>Some would have <hi>Llwndian</hi> the <hi>Wel≈øh</hi> name of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to be derived from <hi>Llhwn</hi> which ≈øignifies a <hi>fenced Town,</hi> made of Trees ca≈øt down and barricadoed together, as aforementioned, for ≈øo the Poet ≈øings.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56661:4"/>
                  <q>
                     <l>‚Äî Their Hou≈øes were the Thicks,</l>
                     <l>And bu≈øhy queachy hollow Caves</l>
                     <l>And Hurdles made of Sticks.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And it is probable, that in the Place where St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church now ≈øtands, there was a Wood or Grove, and a Temple dedicated to <hi>Diana,</hi> which was u≈øually ≈øet up in the Woods; and in a place about St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> there were the Heads and Bones of Oxen lately found, which is ≈øuppo≈øed were offered in Sacrifice to her.</p>
                  <p>Now though it be not certainly known, who was the Founder of <hi>London,</hi> yet whoever it was, he ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much Prudence in the Choice of Scituation; for ≈øhe ≈øeems to have been built in an happy hour, having continued for ≈øo many Ages; <hi>Amianus Marcellinus</hi> who wrote near thirteen hundred years ago, calls her then, an <hi>Ancient City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Romans</hi> had reduced the hither parts of <hi>Brittain</hi> into the form of a Province, and had ≈øown the ≈øeeds of Civility here, as well as over all <hi>Europe,</hi> this City began to be renowned and famous for Wealth, Riches, and Pro≈øperity, yea ≈øhe continued always the ≈øame under the <hi>Romans, Saxons,</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> being ≈øeldom or never afflicted with any great Calamities. In the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> when the <hi>Brittains</hi> had con≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to recover their lo≈øt Liberty, under the Conduct of <hi>Boadicia,</hi> the <hi>Londoners</hi> could not with all their weeping and Lamentations, keep <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> in the City, but after he had rai≈øed a Power of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, he would needs go from thence, leaving the City naked to the Enemy, who pre≈øently ≈øurprized it, and ≈ølew tho≈øe whom either weakne≈øs, feeblene≈øs, or ≈øweetne≈øs of the place, had detained there. Nor was <hi>London</hi> in le≈øs danger by the <hi>Gaules</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> if ≈øhe had not been wonderfully pre≈øerved, for when <hi>Caius Alectus,</hi> had Treacherou≈øly de≈øtroyed <hi>Carau≈øius,</hi> he kept to him≈øelf the Revenues of <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>

About which time it is Recorded, that <hi>Lucius Gallus</hi> was ≈ølain by a Brook≈øide which ran almo≈øt through the City, and of him was called by the <hi>Brittains, Wantgall,</hi> in <hi>Engli≈øh, Walbrook,</hi> which name remains to this day, under which there is a Sewer within the ground, to carry the Kennel water of the City into the <hi>Thames.</hi> This is not far from <hi>London-≈øtone,</hi> which is thought to be a <hi>Milemark,</hi> or <hi>Miliary,</hi> ≈øuch as were in the Market Places of <hi>Rome,</hi> from which were taken dimen≈øions of Journeys every way, which ≈øeems the more probable, becau≈øe this Stone is near the mid≈øt of the City as it lyeth in length.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Julius Agricola</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Lieutenant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded the <hi>Brittains</hi> to build Hou≈øes for them≈øelves, and Temples for their Gods, to bring up their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Learning, and to Apparel them≈øelves like <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> ≈øo that in a few years after our Saviours Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ≈øhe became famous, but e≈øpecially for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Merchants, Provi≈øion and Trade thereof, as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> notes, and was then called by ≈øome Authors <hi>Londinum,</hi> by others <hi>Augu≈øta,</hi> under which name her Fame is celebrated by an Ancient Author, which is thus Tran≈ølated by <hi>Philemon Holland;</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>HI≈øtorians report, That about the year after Chri≈øt 306, <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> the Great, at the de≈øire of his Mother <hi>Helena,</hi> did fir≈øt build a Wall about this City, which may ≈øeem more probable, con≈øidering that the <hi>Brittains</hi> did under≈øtand how to build Walls with Stone, as may appear by the following Relation.</p>
                  <p>About the Year of Chri≈øt 399, when the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> was invaded, and that City de≈øtroyed by the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> called away all their Forces from <hi>Brittain</hi> for the Defence of their own Countrey; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the <hi>Brittains</hi> being not able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, were for many years oppre≈ø≈øed by two cruel Nations, that is, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> whereupon they ≈øent Amba≈ø≈øadors, with Letters full of Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Supplications and Complaints to <hi>Rome,</hi> to de≈øire their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, promi≈øing con≈øtant Obedience to them. The <hi>Romans</hi> ≈øent them a Legion of Souldiers, who fought with their Enemies and drove them out of the Countrey; And leaving the <hi>Brittains</hi> at Liberty they advi≈øed them to make a Wall cro≈øs the Countrey from one Sea to the other, for their defence again≈øt their trouble≈øome Neighbours; and then the <hi>Romans</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home in Triumph.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Brittains</hi> built this Wall in the North of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but wanting Ma≈øons, they did not make it of Stone as the <hi>Romans</hi> directed, but of Turf, which was ≈øo weak, that it was little Security to them. For their Enemies perceiving the <hi>Romans</hi> were gone, they pre≈øently came in Boats, and invaded their Countrey, ruining and wa≈øting all before them. Upon which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56661:6"/>Amba≈ø≈øadors were again ≈øent with fre≈øh Lamentations to <hi>Rome,</hi> be≈øeeching them not to ≈øuffer their mi≈øerable Countrey to be wholy de≈øtroyed; The <hi>Romans</hi> then ≈øent them another Legion, who coming ≈øuddenly, ≈øurprized their Enemies and made a great ≈ølaughter among them, cha≈øing them back again even to their own Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> departing home again, told the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> plainly, that the Journey hither was long and trouble≈øome, and therefore they mu≈øt expect no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther help from them; but mu≈øt learn to u≈øe Armour, and weapons them≈øelves, thereby to be able to re≈øi≈øt their Enemies, who were incouraged to invade them becau≈øe of their Cowardice and Faintheartedne≈øs; However for the incouragement of their Tributary Friends, whom they were now forced to for≈øake the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> made them a Wall of hard Stone from the We≈øt Sea to the Ea≈øt Sea, and built two Cities at each end thereof, the <hi>Brittains</hi> labouring therein al≈øo. This Wall was built Eight Foot thick, and twelve Foot high, directly Ea≈øt and We≈øt, as appears by the ruins to be ≈øeen at this day. The work being fini≈øhed; the <hi>Romans</hi> gave them a ≈øtrict charge to look to them≈øelves, and to in≈øtruct their People in the u≈øe of Arms, and Millitary Di≈øcipline, and lea≈øt the Enemy ≈øhould come by Sea, Southward, they made divers Bulwarks at ≈øome di≈øtance from each other by the Sea≈øide; And then bid the <hi>Brittains</hi> farewel, as intending to return no more; This happened in the Reign of <hi>Theodo≈øius</hi> the younger; near 500 years after the fir≈øt Arrival of the <hi>Romans</hi> here, and about the year of our Lord 434.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Brittains</hi> after this had ≈øeveral Skirmi≈øhes with the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and made Choice of <hi>Vortiger</hi> to be their King and Leader, who is ≈øaid to have been nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wi≈øe nor Valiant, being wholly given up to Lu≈øt and Debauchery; And the People likewi≈øe having ≈øome re≈øt from their Enemies, ran into Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56661:7"/>Drunkenne≈øs, Pride, Contention, Envy, and all manner of Vice, to the great ≈øcandal of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Profe≈ø≈øion. At which time a dreadful Pe≈øtilence fell upon them, which de≈øtroyed ≈øuch a multitude of them, that the quick were not ≈øufficient to bury the dead, and yet tho≈øe that remained alive continued ≈øo impenitent, that neither the death of their Friends, nor fear of their Enemies had any Effect upon them, whereupon Divine Ju≈øtice pur≈øued them even almo≈øt to the De≈øtruction of the whole ≈øinful Nation</p>
                  <p>For being now again in danger of utter ruin from their old Neighbours the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øult with their King <hi>Vortiger</hi> what to do, and at la≈øt conclude to call in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who ≈øoon after arrived in <hi>Brittain;</hi> where (≈øaith <hi>Bede</hi>) they were received as Friends, For having driven out the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> they likewi≈øe drove out the <hi>Brittains,</hi> forcing ≈øome of them to fly over the Seas, and others into the barren and wa≈øte Mountains of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> were likewi≈øe ignorant of building with Stone till the year 680. for it is affirmed that <hi>Bennet</hi> Abbot of <hi>Werral,</hi> and Ma≈øter to Reverend <hi>Bede,</hi> fir≈øt brought in Artificers for Stone hou≈øes, and Gla≈øs Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, unknown before to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who built only with Wood. And to this <hi>Polychronicon</hi> agrees; who ≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tho≈øe times, ≈øaith, <hi>Then had ye wooden Churches, nay wooden Chalices, but Golden Priests; but now you have Golden Chalices, and Wooden Prie≈øts.</hi> And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Argument, King <hi>Edgar</hi> in his Charter to the Abby of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> dated the year of Chri≈øt 974, writes to this Effect; <hi>All the Mona≈øteries in my Realm to the outward ≈øight are nothing but wormeaten and rotten Timber, and Boards, and which is wor≈øe, within they are almost empty, and void of Divine Wor≈øhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much as to Walls in General, now to return to <hi>London;</hi> This City was de≈øtroyed and burnt by the <hi>Danes,</hi> and other Pagan Enemies, about the year of our Lord 839, and was nobly rebuilt, and repaired in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56661:7"/>the year 886 by <hi>Alfred</hi> King of the <hi>We≈øt Saxons,</hi> ≈øo that it lay wa≈øte, and uninhabited for almo≈øt fifty years; <hi>Alfred</hi> committed the cu≈øtody of this new built City to his Son in Law <hi>Etheldred</hi> Earl of <hi>Mercia,</hi> to whom he had before married his Daughter <hi>Ethelsted;</hi> And that this City was then ≈øtrongly Walled may appear by divers Accidents; <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> writes, that about the year 994 the <hi>Londoners</hi> ≈øhut up their Gates and defended their King <hi>Etheldred</hi> within their Walls again≈øt the <hi>Danes.</hi> In the year 1016, <hi>Canutus</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> made War again≈øt <hi>Edmond Iron≈øide,</hi> King of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> and brought his Navy to the We≈øt part of the Bridge, ca≈øting a Trench about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and attempted to have won it by a≈ø≈øault, but the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens repul≈øed him, and drove him from their Walls. Likewi≈øe in the year 1052, Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> with his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Sailed up by the South end of the Bridge, and a≈ø≈øailed the Walls of this City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>William Fitz Stephen</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 2. writes thus, <hi>The Wall of</hi> London <hi>is High and Great, well To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered on the North ≈øide, with due distance between the Towers. On the South ≈øide al≈øo the City was Walled and Towered, but the Fi≈øhful River of</hi> Thames <hi>by his ebbing and flowing hath long ≈øince ≈øubverted them.</hi> Where by the North≈øide he means from the River in the Ea≈øt to the River of <hi>Thames</hi> in the We≈øt, for ≈øo the Wall ≈øtretched in his time, and the City being far longer from Ea≈øt to We≈øt, than in breadth from South to North, and al≈øo narrower at both ends than in the mid≈øt, is therefore compa≈ø≈øed with the Wall on the Land≈øide in the form of a Bow, except where it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented in betwixt <hi>Cripplegate</hi> and <hi>Alder≈øgate.</hi> But the Wall on the South≈øide along the River of <hi>Thames</hi> was ≈øtreight as the ≈øtring of a Bow and fortified with Towers or Bulwarks (as we now term them) in due di≈øtance from each other, as our Author ≈øays, and we our ≈øelves may ob≈øerve at this day, this demon≈øtrates that the Walls of this City are of great Antiquity.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56661:8"/>
                  <p>Now for repairing and maintaining this Wall, we find, That in the year 1215 and the 6th of King <hi>John.</hi> The Barons entring the City by <hi>Aldgate,</hi> fir≈øt took A≈ø≈øurance of the City, and then broke into the <hi>Jews</hi> hou≈øes, and ≈øeizing their Money and Goods for their own u≈øes, they with great diligence repaired the Walls, and Gates of this City, with Stones taken from the <hi>Jews</hi> broken Hou≈øes. In the year 1257, <hi>Henry</hi> 3. ordered the Walls of this City which were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed and without Towers to be hand≈øomely repaired, and beautified at the common Charge of the City.</p>
                  <p>In the 17th of <hi>Edward</hi> 4. <hi>Ralph Joceline</hi> Mayor cau≈øed part of the Wall of the City of <hi>London</hi> to be repaired between <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and <hi>Alder≈øgate;</hi> He al≈øo cau≈øed <hi>Morefields</hi> to be ≈øearched for Clay to make brick for that purpo≈øe. The <hi>Skinners</hi> made that part of the Wall between <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and <hi>Buvies Marks,</hi> (commonly call'd <hi>Bevis Marks</hi>) toward <hi>Bi≈øhop≈øgate,</hi> as may appear by their Arms fixed in three places there; The Lord Mayor, and his Company of <hi>Drapers</hi> made all that part between <hi>Bi≈øhop≈øgate</hi> and <hi>Alhallows</hi> Church in the Wall, and from <hi>Alhallows</hi> toward the <hi>Po≈øtern</hi> called <hi>Moregate.</hi> A great part of the ≈øame Wall was repaired by the Executors of Sir <hi>John Crosby</hi> Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, his Arms being in 2 places; and other Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies repaired the re≈øt of the Wall to <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> the Gold≈ømiths repaired from <hi>Cripplegate</hi> to <hi>Alder≈øgate,</hi> and there the work cea≈øed.</p>
                  <p>The Circuit of the VVall of <hi>London</hi> on the Lands ≈øide, that is from the Tower of <hi>London</hi> in the Ea≈øt to <hi>Aldgate</hi> is 82 Perches; From <hi>Aldgate</hi> to <hi>Bi≈øhop≈øgate</hi> 86 Perchees; From <hi>Bi≈øhop≈øgate</hi> to <hi>Cripplegate</hi> 162 Perches; From <hi>Cripplegate</hi> to <hi>Alder≈øgate</hi> 75 Perches; From <hi>Alder≈øgate</hi> to <hi>Newgate</hi> 66 Perches; From <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> to <hi>Ludgate</hi> 42 Perches; in all 513 Perches of A≈ø≈øize. From <hi>Ludgate</hi> to <hi>Fleet</hi> Ditch 60 Perches; From <hi>Fleetbridge</hi> to the River of <hi>Thames</hi> about 70 Perches. So that the total of the≈øe Perches amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56661:8"/>to 643; and every Perch being 5 Yards and an half, makes 3536 Yards and an half, containing 10608 Foot, which is two <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Miles and 608 Foot more.</p>
                  <p>In former time there were but four Gates in the VVall of this City, that is <hi>Aldgate</hi> for the Ea≈øt; <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øgate</hi> for the North; <hi>Ludgate</hi> for the VVe≈øt; and <hi>Bridgate</hi> over <hi>London Bridge</hi> for the South, but of late days for the Conveniency of Pa≈ø≈øengers, divers other Gates and Po≈øterns have been made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fitz Stephen</hi> ≈øaith, that in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 2 there were ≈øeven Double Gates in the VVall of this City, but names them not, we may therefore ≈øuppo≈øe them to be, 1. The Gate next the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> called the <hi>Postern.</hi> 2. <hi>Aldgate.</hi> 3. <hi>Bi≈øhop≈øgate.</hi> 4. <hi>Alder≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi> 5. <hi>Newgate.</hi> 6. <hi>Ludgate.</hi> 7. <hi>Bridge-gate.</hi> Since which there hath been built <hi>Moregate,</hi> now a Famous Gate and ≈øeveral other ≈ømaller Po≈øterns, as one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Bi≈øhop≈øgate</hi> and <hi>Moregate,</hi> and two between <hi>Moregate</hi> and <hi>Cripplegate;</hi> be≈øides other in other Places.</p>
                  <p>As to the fir≈øt called the <hi>Po≈øtern</hi> near the Tower (which was de≈øtroyed by the dreadful Fire in 1666 of which you have a particular Account in this Treati≈øe and never ≈øince rebuilt or like to be) by that which remained of it before, it ≈øeemed to have been a fair ≈øtrong Arched Gate, built of hard Stone. In the year 1190, and the 2. of <hi>Richard</hi> 1. <hi>William Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhamp,</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Ely</hi> Chancellor, cau≈øed part of the City VVall from that Gate to the <hi>White Tower</hi> to be broken down, for inlarging the <hi>Tower,</hi> round which he made a VVall imbattelled, which is now the outer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt VVall; He likewi≈øe made a broad deep Ditch without the VVall, to let in the Tyde from the <hi>Thames;</hi> But the South≈øide of this Gate was by undermining the Foundation much weakned, and about two Hundred years after, that is 1440, the 18 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. it fell down, and was never ≈øince rebuilt.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56661:9"/>
                  <p>The next in the Ea≈øt, is <hi>ALDGATE,</hi> or <hi>Oldgate</hi> of the Antiquity thereof, having been one of the four Principal Gates, and al≈øo one of the ≈øeven Double Gates aforementioned; It had two pair of Gates and Portculli≈øes, though now but one; yet the hooks of the other Gate, and the place of letting down the other Portcullice are yet to be ≈øeen. This Gate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be very Ancient, being named in a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in King <hi>Edgars</hi> time; and likewi≈øe in K. <hi>Edward</hi> 1. And in the Civil VVars between K. <hi>John,</hi> and his Barons 1215. the <hi>Londoners</hi> were on the Barons part, who then be≈øieged <hi>Northampton,</hi> and after came to <hi>Bedford</hi> Ca≈øtle, where they were well received by <hi>William Beauchamp</hi> Captain thereof; and having then ≈øecret Notice, that if they plea≈øed they might enter the City, they removed their Camp to <hi>Ware,</hi> and from thence coming to <hi>London</hi> in the Night, they entred by <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and placing Guards at the Gates, they di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed of all things at their plea≈øure.</p>
                  <p>They ≈øpoiled the Fryers Hou≈øes, and ≈øearcht their Coffers; after which <hi>Robert Fitzwater, Jeffery Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> the Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> cheif Commander in the Army applied them≈øelves to repair the Gates and VValls of the City, with ≈øtones taken from the <hi>Jews</hi> Hou≈øes as afore≈øaid; and <hi>Aldgate</hi> being mo≈øt ruinous, and having given them an ea≈øie entrance, they repaired, or rather new built it, after the manner of the <hi>Normans,</hi> with ≈øtrong Arches, and Bulwarks of Stone, ≈ømall brick, and <hi>Flanders</hi> Tile.</p>
                  <p>In the 11 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 1471, <hi>Thomas</hi> Ba≈øtard <hi>Faucon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> having A≈ø≈øembled a Riotous Company of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and others in <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> came with a great Navy of Ships up to the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the L.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56661:9"/>they fell upon <hi>Aldgate, Bi≈øhop≈øgate, Cripplegate, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øgate, London Bridge,</hi> and along the Bank≈øide, ≈øhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arrows, and Guns into the City, and burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three≈øcore hou≈øes in the Suburbs.</p>
                  <p>And upon Sunday <hi>May</hi> 11, 1471.

And <hi>Robert Ba≈ø≈øet</hi> Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of that Ward, commanded them in the name of God to draw up the Portcullice, which being done, the <hi>Londoners</hi> i≈ø≈øued out of the Gate, and couragiou≈øly beat back their Enemies to St. <hi>Buttolphs</hi> Church, by which time, the Earl <hi>Rivers</hi> and the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> coming with fre≈øh Forces, joined them, and then they ≈øoon routed the Rebels, and made them fly, Alderman <hi>Ba≈ø≈øet</hi> and other Citizens cha≈øing them to <hi>Miland,</hi> and from thence, pur≈øued ≈øome of them to <hi>Poplar,</hi> and others to <hi>Stratford,</hi> killing many, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers Pri≈øoners.

                  <p>The third Gate toward the North, is <hi>BISHOPS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATE;</hi> ≈øuppo≈øed to be built by ≈øome Bi≈øhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> though now unknown; But the occa≈øion thereof was for the ea≈øe of Pa≈ø≈øengers, e≈øpecially to <hi>Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridg≈øhire,</hi> &amp;c. who before were forced to go much about; yet it is ≈øomewhat Ancient, for we read that in the year 1210, ≈øome Land was ≈øold to the Procurators or Wardens of <hi>London Bridge,</hi> ≈øituate in the Pari≈øh of St. <hi>Buttolph</hi> without <hi>Bi≈øhop≈øgate.</hi> And in a Charter dated 1235.

                  </p>
                  <p>And for repairing this Gate, <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. confirmed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Liberties to the Merchants of the <hi>Haunce</hi> to keep it in repair, which they did for many years; But in the year 1551, having prepared Stone and a new Gate to be ≈øet up, at the Complaint of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Merchants their Charter was taken from them, ≈øo that the Old Gate remained.</p>
                  <p>Next to this upon the North≈øide of the City, is <hi>MOREGATE;</hi> of which we read, that in the 3d of <hi>Hen.</hi> 5. 1415, <hi>Thomas Faulconer</hi> Mayor, cau≈øed the VVall of the City to be broken through near <hi>Coleman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtreet,</hi> and there builded a <hi>Po≈øtern,</hi> now called <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> of a Moory ground hard by, which is now drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made fair and firm, and turned into ≈øeveral Feilds and delightful VValks, with Trees ≈øet in curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Order for the Accommodation of the Citizens; This Gate ≈øince the dreadful Fire of <hi>London</hi> in 1666 has been new built and is made very Noble with a great Arch and two Po≈øterns, ≈øo that it now equals, if not excels any other Gate of the City.</p>
                  <p>Between this Gate and <hi>Cripplegate</hi> there have been lately made two Po≈øterns through the VVall, for the better ea≈øe of Pa≈ø≈øengers, and ≈øeveral new Hou≈øes built near them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>CRIPPLEGATE</hi> is next, which is of great Antiquity being ≈øo called before the Conque≈øt, for we read that in 1010, the <hi>Danes</hi> ≈øpoiling the Kingdom of the <hi>East-Angles, Alwyn</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Helinham,</hi> cau≈øed the body of King <hi>Edmund</hi> the Martyr to be brought from <hi>Bredi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> (now called St. <hi>Edmunds Bury</hi>) through the Kingdom of the <hi>East-Saxons,</hi> and ≈øo to <hi>London</hi> in at <hi>Cripplegate.</hi> Some ≈øay it was ≈øo named from <hi>Cripples</hi> begging there, and that when the body of St. <hi>Edmund</hi> pa≈ø≈øed through it, many Miracles were wrought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as that ≈øome of the Lame were cured, prai≈øing God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Body continued three years in St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories

                  <p>This Gate was formerly a Pri≈øon for Citizens for Debt or otherwi≈øe, like one of the Counters; It was new built in 1244 by the Brewers of <hi>London;</hi> and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Shaw</hi> Gold≈ømith in 1483. gave by his VVill 400 Marks, and the ≈øtuff of the the old Gate called <hi>Cripple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> to build the ≈øame again, which was accordingly done in 1491.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ALDERSGATE</hi> or <hi>Aelder≈øgate</hi> is next, not ≈øo called from <hi>Aldwich,</hi> or of <hi>Elders,</hi> or Ancient men building the ≈øame, nor of Elder Trees growing more plentifully there than in other places, as ≈øome have fancied; but only from the Antiquity thereof, it being one of the four fir≈øt Gates of this City, ≈øerving for the Northern, as <hi>Aldgate</hi> doth for the Ea≈øtern Parts, and being both Old Gates, for di≈øtinction, one is called <hi>Alder≈øgate,</hi> and the other <hi>Aldgate;</hi> This Gate hath had ≈øeveral Additional buildings to it, as on the South≈øide, where ≈øeveral large Rooms and Lodgings of Timber have been made; And on the Ea≈øt≈øide a Great Timber building with one large Room paved with Stone or Tile) there is likewi≈øe a well curbed with Stone, and of a great depth, which ri≈øes into that Room though two Stories high from the Ground, which is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable; <hi>John Day</hi> a famous Printer, dwelt in this Gate, and built many Hou≈øes upon the City wall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward St. <hi>Anns Church.</hi> You may read more of the new building this Gate in <hi>Alder≈øgate</hi> Ward.</p>

                  <p>In the ≈øixth year of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Three was a <hi>Po≈øtern Gate</hi> made through the City VVall on the North≈øide of the late di≈ø≈øolved Cloi≈øter of <hi>Friars Minors,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called <hi>Gray Friars;</hi> Now <hi>Chri≈øt Church,</hi> and <hi>Ho≈øpital;</hi> this was done to make a Pa≈ø≈øage from <hi>Chri≈øt Church</hi> Ho≈øpital, to St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> Ho≈øpital in <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and Licen≈øe was given to Sir <hi>Richard Dobbs,</hi> Lord Mayor to do it, by Virtue of an Act of Common Council, <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. in the 6 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>The next Gate is on the Northwe≈øt, and is called <hi>NEWGATE,</hi> and is the fifth Principal Gate, though built later than the re≈øt, being erected about the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. or K. <hi>Stephen</hi> upon this occa≈øion. The Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> being burnt down in the Reign of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour 1086. <hi>Mauritius</hi> then Bi≈øhop of <hi>London,</hi> did not repair the Old Church as ≈øome have thought, but laid the Foundation of a new one, which it was judged would hardly ever have been fini≈øhed, it was ≈øo wonderful for length, bredth, and height; and likewi≈øe becau≈øe it was rai≈øed upon Vaults or Arches, after the <hi>Norman</hi> fa≈øhion, and never known in <hi>England</hi> before.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Mauritius, Richard Beumore</hi> did very much advance the building of this Church purcha≈øing the large Streets and Lanes round about, which ground he incompa≈ø≈øed with a ≈øtrong Stone VVall and Gates: By rea≈øon of this inclo≈øure for ≈øo large a Church-yard, the High-≈øtreet from <hi>Aldgate</hi> in the Ea≈øt, to <hi>Ludgate</hi> in the <hi>We≈øt,</hi> was made ≈øo ≈øtreight and narrow, that the Carriage through the City was by <hi>Paterno≈øter-Row,</hi> down <hi>Ave-Mary</hi> Lane, and ≈øo through <hi>Bouger Row</hi> (now called <hi>Ludgate≈øtreet</hi>) to <hi>Ludgate;</hi> or el≈øe by <hi>Cheap≈øide</hi> through <hi>Watlingstreet,</hi> and ≈øo through <hi>Carter-lane,</hi> and up <hi>Creed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> which Pa≈ø≈øage by rea≈øon of the often turning was very Inconvenient.</p>
                  <p>VVhereupon a New Gate was made to pa≈øs through <hi>Cheap≈øide</hi> (North of St. <hi>Pauls</hi>) St. <hi>Nicholas Shambles,</hi> and <hi>Newgate-≈øtreet</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and from thence we≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

That King writ to the Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> commanding them to repair the Goal of <hi>Newgate,</hi> for the ≈øafe keeping of his Pri≈øoners, promi≈øing that the Charges thereof ≈øhould be allowed them upon their Account in the Exchequer.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1241. The <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Norwich</hi> were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed being accu≈øed for Circumci≈øing a Chri≈øtian Child; their Hou≈øe (called the <hi>Thor</hi>) was pulled down and de≈øtroyed; <hi>Aaron</hi> the Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> were con≈øtrained to pay twenty thou≈øand Marks, at two Terms in the year, or el≈øe to be kept perpetual Pri≈øoners in <hi>Newgate</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and in other Pri≈øons.</p>
                  <p>In 1255, King <hi>Henry</hi> 3. lodged in the Tower, and upon ≈øome di≈øplea≈øure again≈øt the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the e≈øcape of <hi>John Offrem</hi> a Clerk Convict, Pri≈øoner in <hi>Newgate,</hi> for killing a Prior who was Cou≈øin to the Queen, He ≈øent for the Lord Mayor, who laid the fault on the Sheriffs to who≈øe Cu≈øtody the Pri≈øoners are committed; the Mayor was di≈øcharged, but the Sheriffs were impri≈øoned above a month, though they alledged the fault was in the Bi≈øhops Officers, who though he was impri≈øoned in <hi>Newgate,</hi> yet they were to ≈øee that he was kept ≈øafe. But however the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired three thou≈øand Marks of the City for a Fine.</p>
                  <p>In the third year of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 1326. <hi>Robert Baldock</hi> the Kings Chancellor was put into <hi>Newgate.</hi> In 1237, Sir <hi>John Pouitney</hi> gave four Marks a year for releif of the Pri≈øoners in <hi>Newgate.</hi> In 1358, <hi>William Walworth</hi> gave likewi≈øe toward their relief, and ≈øo have many others ≈øince. In 1414, the Jaylors in <hi>Ludgate</hi> and <hi>Newgate</hi> died, and 64 Pri≈øoners. In 1418, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56661:12"/>of <hi>Wertham</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> was Impri≈øoned in <hi>Newgate.</hi> In the fir≈øt of <hi>Henry</hi> 6, 1412. The Executors of <hi>Richard Whittington</hi> repaired <hi>Newgate.</hi> And <hi>Thomas Knowles</hi> Grocer, ≈øometimes L.

In 1431, all the Pri≈øoners in <hi>Ludgate</hi> were conveyed to <hi>Newgate,</hi> by the Sheriffs of <hi>London;</hi> And ≈øoon after they fetcht from thence 18 Per≈øons, Freemen of the City, who were led pinioned to the Counters like Felons, by the fal≈øe ≈øugge≈øtion of the Jaylor of <hi>Newgate;</hi> But <hi>Ludgate</hi> was a while after again appointed for Freemen who were Debtors; and they were all carried back again thither.</p>
                  <p>In 1427. There was a great Skirmi≈øh in the North Countrey between Sir <hi>Thomas Percie,</hi> Lord <hi>Egremond,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Salisburies</hi> Sons, whereby many were wounded and ≈ølain, but the Lord <hi>Egremond</hi> being taken was found to give the occa≈øion, and was thereupon condemned by the Kings Council, to pay a con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sum of Money to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and in the mean time was committed to <hi>Newgate;</hi> and a while after both he, and his Brother Sir <hi>Richard Percie</hi> brake out by night, and went to the King. The other Pri≈øoners got upon the Leads over the Gate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it again≈øt the Sheriffs, and all their Officers a great while, till they were forced to call more Citizens to their Aid, who at la≈øt ≈øubdued them, and laid them in Irons; Thus much of <hi>Newgate.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>LUDGATE</hi> is the next in the VVe≈øt, and the Sixth Principal Gate of this City, and Hi≈øtorians ≈øay, was built by King <hi>Lud,</hi> near 66 years before our Saviours Nativity; which ≈øhews its great Antiquity; This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built for the VVe≈øt, as <hi>Aldgate</hi> for the Ea≈øt.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1215. aforementioned, being the 17th. of King <hi>John,</hi> when the Barons who were in Arms again≈øt the King, entred this City, and pull'd down
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56661:12"/>the <hi>Jews</hi> Hou≈øes, repairing the VValls and Gates of the City with the Stones thereof; It appeareth that they then repaired or rather new built this Gate; For in 1586 when this Gate was pulled down in order to its being repaired, there was a ≈øtone found within the wall, which ≈øeems to have been taken from one of the <hi>Jews</hi> Hou≈øes, there being ≈øeveral <hi>Hebrew</hi> Characters ingraven thereon, which being interpreted are thus in <hi>Engli≈øh; This is the Station or Ward of Rabbi</hi> Mo≈øes, <hi>the Son of the Honourable Rabbi</hi> I≈øaac. This it is thought had been fixed upon one of the <hi>Jews</hi> Hou≈øes, as a ≈øign he lived there.</p>
                  <p>In 1260, <hi>Ludgate</hi> was repaired, and beautified with the Images of <hi>Lud</hi> and other Kings, but in the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. the≈øe Images of the Kings had their Heads ≈ømitten off, and were defaced, by ≈øuch as judged every Image to be an Idol; In the Reign of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> they were repaired and new heads ≈øet upon their old Bodies, which remained ≈øo, till the 28 of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1586. VVhen this Gate was quite taken down and nobly Rebuilt, with the Images of K. <hi>Lud</hi> and others on the Ea≈øt-≈øide, and Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> on the VVe≈øt, which was done at the City Charge being above 1500 pounds.</p>
                  <p>In 1463. <hi>Stephen Foster</hi> Fi≈øhmonger, and Dame <hi>Agnes</hi> his VVife, added ≈øeveral large Rooms to <hi>Ludgate,</hi> and gave other releif to the Pri≈øoners, who are only ≈øuch Citizens as are Debtors; All Per≈øons for Trea≈øons, Felonies, and other Criminal Offences being commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Newgate.</hi> In one of the≈øe rooms, there was a Copper Plate hanging with the following Rhimes ingraven thereon.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Next to this before the late Fire, there was only a breach in the VVall of the City and a Bridge of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber over <hi>Fleet</hi> Ditch; directly again≈øt <hi>Bridewell</hi> Ho≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but ≈øince, it is all laid open, and a hand≈øome Bridge of Stone built in that Place, the Ditch being very much enlarged, and a VVharf made of Stone, and cleared from all Hou≈øes on each ≈øide up to <hi>Holborn</hi> Bridge. The Bridge likewi≈øe at the lower end of <hi>Ludgate</hi> Hill being nobly rebuilt, or rather new built and made much broader, and another Gallant Bridge is built upon the ≈øame Ditch almo≈øt over again≈øt the <hi>Fleet</hi> Pri≈øon.

                  <p>Then there is the <hi>BRIDG-GATE,</hi> ≈øo called of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Bridge whereon it ≈øtandeth; This long before the Conque≈øt was one of the four fir≈øt, or Principal Gates of the City, where there was only a Bridge of Timber, and is the ≈øeventh and la≈øt Principal Gate mentioned by <hi>Fitz Stephen;</hi> when the Bridge was new built of Stone, this Gate was rebuilt again; In the year 1436, this Gate with the Tower upon it fell down, and two of the furthe≈øt Arches of the Bridg, Southward fell therewith, yet none were killed, or hurt thereby; to the repairing whereof ≈øeveral Citizens gave very Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. When the Ba≈øtard <hi>Fauconbridg</hi> aforenamed came with the <hi>Kenti≈øh</hi> Mariners into this City, they burnt this Gate, and thirteen Hou≈øes be≈øides on the Bridge, and likewi≈øe the Brewhou≈øes at St. <hi>Katherines</hi> and many others in the Suburbs.</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56661:15"/>
                  <p>Next hereunto was a Gate, commonly called <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolphs</hi> Gate, of the Pari≈øh Church adjoyning, This was given; or confirmed by <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> to the Monks of <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter.</hi> Then there is <hi>Billing≈øgate,</hi> which is much u≈øed by ≈ømall Ships &amp; Barges, ≈øo that <hi>Queen Hyth</hi> is almo≈øt for≈øaken. It is ≈øomewhat uncertain why this Gate was ≈øo named, only <hi>Jeffry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> writes, that <hi>Belin</hi> a King of the <hi>Brittains</hi> about 400 years before Chri≈øts Nativity, built this Gate, and called it after his own name, &amp; that when he was dead his Body was burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the A≈øhes were put into a ve≈ø≈øel of Bra≈øs, and ≈øet over that Gate upon an High Pinacle of Stone; yet it doth not ≈øeem to be ≈øo Ancient, but rather to have taken the name from ≈øome late Owner, called (it may be) <hi>Beling,</hi> or <hi>Billing,</hi> as <hi>Somers</hi> Key, <hi>Smarts</hi> Key, <hi>Fre≈øh Warf</hi> and others have done; Then there was a Watergate on the South-end of <hi>Water-lane</hi> by the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtom-hou≈øe</hi> Key, but of all the≈øe more hereafter. One other Watergate there was more by the <hi>Bulwark</hi> of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and this is the la≈øt, and farthe≈øt Gate Ea≈øtward on the River of <hi>Thames</hi> as far as the City of <hi>London</hi> extends within the Walls.</p>
                  <p>Be≈øides the≈øe Common Water Gates, there were formerly divers private Wharfs, and Keys all along from the Ea≈øt to the We≈øt of this City, on the <hi>Thames</hi> ≈øide, where Merchants of all Nations landed their Goods, and had Warehou≈øes, Cellars, and Stowage form them.

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of the Tower of</hi> London, <hi>(and other Ancient Towers and Ca≈øtles of this City) with ≈øeveral Remarkable Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents happening therein.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe City of <hi>London</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Fitz Stephen</hi>) hath in the Ea≈øt a very Great, and mo≈øt Strong <hi>Palatine</hi> Tower, who≈øe Turrets and Walls do ri≈øe from a deep Foundation, the Mortar thereof being tempered with the Bloud of Bea≈øts.</p>
                  <p>It is the Common Opinion that <hi>Julius Cae≈øar</hi> the fir≈øt Conquerour, or indeed Di≈øcoverer of <hi>Brittain</hi> was the Original Founder thereof and of many other Towers Ca≈øtles and Great Hou≈øes. But there is little Rea≈øon for it, in regard of his ≈øhort ≈øtay here, having other things to think on, de≈øigning only to di≈øpatch his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt over this Barbarous Countrey, and then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form greater Enterprizes; Neither do the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi≈øtorians mention any ≈øuch Buildings erected by him here.</p>
                  <p>The more probable Opinion therefore is, That <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour built the Great white and ≈øquare Tower there about the year of our Lord 1078, as appears by Ancient Records, and that made <hi>Gundulph</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Roche≈øter</hi> Principal Surveyor of the work. The Wall of the City of <hi>London</hi> (as it is aforementioned) was furni≈øhed formerly with Towers, and Bulwarks in due di≈øtance from each other; and the River of <hi>Thames</hi> with its Ebbing and Flowing had overthrown the Walls and Towers on the Banks thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour for the defence of the City which lay open to the Enemy, having taken down
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56661:16"/>the ≈øecond Bulwark in the Ea≈øt part of the Wall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Thames,</hi> built the Great <hi>White Tower,</hi> which hath been ≈øince enlarged at ≈øeveral times with buildings adjoining thereto; This Tower in the 4th. of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> 1092. was much ≈øhaken and defaced by a great Tempe≈øt of Wind; but was again repaired by <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the fir≈øt, who likewi≈øe built a Ca≈øtle on the South-≈øide thereof toward the <hi>Thames,</hi> intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame round about. Hi≈øtorians ≈øay of this <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rufus, That he challenged the Inve≈øtiture of Prelates, He pilled, and ≈øhared the People with Tribute, e≈øpecially to ≈øpend about the Tower of</hi> London, <hi>and the Great Hall at</hi> We≈øtmin≈øter.</p>
                  <p>The four fir≈øt Con≈øtables or Keepers of the Tower were <hi>Othowerus, Acolinillus, Otto,</hi> and <hi>Jeffry Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> who was al≈øo Sheriff of <hi>London, Middle≈øex, E≈ø≈øex</hi> and <hi>Hertford≈øhire;</hi> He fortified the Tower of <hi>London</hi> again≈øt K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> but the King ≈øeizing him at his Court at St. <hi>Albans</hi> would not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him, till he had delivered it up, together with the Ca≈øtles of <hi>Walden,</hi> and <hi>Pla≈øhey</hi> in <hi>E≈ø≈øex.</hi> In 1153, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and Ca≈øtle of <hi>Wind≈øor</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the King to <hi>Richard de Lucie,</hi> to be ≈øafely kept. In 1155, <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Chancellor to <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. cau≈øed the <hi>Flemings</hi> to be bani≈øhed out of <hi>England,</hi> their Ca≈øtles lately built to be demoli≈øhed, and the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to be repaired.</p>
                  <p>In the 2. of <hi>Rich.</hi> fir≈øt, 1190. <hi>William Long≈øhamp</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> (by rea≈øon of ≈øome difference between him, and Earl <hi>John</hi> the Kings Brother, who was in Rebellion) inclo≈øed the Tower and Ca≈øtle of <hi>London</hi> with an outward Wall of Stone embatailed; and likewi≈øe cau≈øed a deep ditch to be made about the ≈øame, de≈øigning (as is aforementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) to have invironed it with the River of <hi>Thames.</hi> This inclo≈øure and Ditch took away ≈øome ground from <hi>Trinity</hi> Church in <hi>London,</hi> which King <hi>Edward</hi> recompenced. And a great quantity of Ground like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56661:16"/>was taken from the City upon this Account, yet the Citizens had no recompence, nor were offended thereat, ≈øince it was done with their liking, as being for the defence of the City.</p>
                  <p>But another Hi≈øtorian ≈øaith, that in 1239, <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. Fortified the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to another Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, and the Citizens fearing it was intended to their detriment, complained to the King; who an≈øwered, <hi>That he had not done it to their hurt, but</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>I will do from henceforth as my Brother doth, (in building and fortifying Castles) who beareth the name of being wi≈øer than I.</hi> But the next year, all the≈øe Noble Buildings of the Stone Gate and Bulwark, were ≈øhaken as with an Earthquake, and fell down; which the King commanded to be again built better than before. And in the year 1241. Though the King had be≈øtowed above 12000 Marks in the work, yet the Wall and Bulwarks irrecoverably fell down; at which the Citizens were very well plea≈øed; for they were threatned, that when this Wall and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks were built, if any of them ≈øhould contend for the Liberties of the City they ≈øhould be Impri≈øoned therein.</p>
                  <p>Yet were they again rebuilt and fini≈øhed by <hi>Edward</hi> the 1. and the Bulwark at the We≈øt-gate, now called the Lyon Tower, added; the Original of which name, and of Lyons in <hi>England,</hi> we read was thus. <hi>Henry</hi> the 1. built the Mannor of <hi>Woodflock,</hi> and walled the Park about with ≈øtone, ≈øeven Miles in compa≈øs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroying to that purpo≈øe divers Villages, Churches and Chappels, and this was the fir≈øt Park in <hi>England,</hi> and as the Record ≈øaith; <hi>He appointed therein (be≈øides great ≈øtore of Deer) divers ≈øtrange bea≈øts to be kept and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhed, ≈øuch as were brought to him from far Countreys, as Lyons, Leopards, Linxes, Porpentines, and ≈øuch other, for ≈øuch was his Estimation among Outlandi≈øh Princes, that few would willingly offend him.</hi>

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56661:17"/>
                  <p>In the year 1235, we read, that <hi>Frederick</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, ≈øent <hi>Henry</hi> 3. three Leopards in token of his Regal ≈øheild of Arms, wherein they were pictured; ≈øince which time, the Lyons, and other Creatures have been kept in a part of this Bulwark now called the <hi>Lyons Tower.</hi> In the 16 of <hi>Edward</hi> 3. One Lyon, One Lyonefs, One Leopard and two Cattes Lyons were committed to the cu≈øtody of <hi>Robert Boure. Edw.</hi> 4. Fortified the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and inclo≈øed a peice of Ground (We≈øt from the <hi>Lyon Tower</hi>) upon <hi>Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill</hi> with brick, now called the Bulwark. And in the 6th. year of his Reign, he ordered a Scaffold and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to be ≈øet upon the Hill for the Execution of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders upon which the L.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> the 3. and <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. repaired this Tower; but in the 2. of <hi>Edward</hi> 6, 1548. <hi>Nov.</hi> 22. A <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> lodging in the round Bulwark, between the <hi>We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and the <hi>Po≈øtern,</hi> by ≈øetting fire to a Barrel of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder in the night, blew up that Bulwark, yet burnt none but him≈øelf; this Bulwark was ≈øoon rebuilt again. This we≈øt Gate of the Tower is the Principal Gate, for receiving, and delivering all manner of Carriages, and without it, there are divers Bulwarks and Gates turning to the North; within this Gate to the South is a ≈øtrong Po≈øtern for Pa≈ø≈øengers, by the VVard-hou≈øe, over a Drawbridge, which is let down, and pull'd up at plea≈øure.</p>
                  <p>Next to this on the South ≈øide Ea≈øt-ward, is a large VVater-gate (commonly called <hi>Traytors Gate,</hi> becau≈øe ≈øome have been carried in that way) this Gate is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under a ≈øtrong Stone Bridge from the River of <hi>Thames.</hi> Beyond which was a ≈ømall Po≈øtern with a Drawbridge ≈øeldom let down but for receiving in ≈øome Great Per≈øons Pri≈øoners; Further to the Ea≈øt was a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56661:17"/>Great and ≈øtrong Gate called the <hi>Iron Gate,</hi> but not u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally opened. And ≈øo much for the Foundation, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and repairing of the Tower, with the Gates and Po≈øterns. There are many Fair Hou≈øes within the walls of the Tower, wherein the Officers belonging thereto, and other Inhabitants live, there is al≈øo a Chappel.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1196, <hi>William Fitz Ozbet</hi> a Citizen, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiou≈øly moving the People to ≈øtand up for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and not to be ≈øubject to the Rich and Mighty, was taken, and brought before the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the Tower where he was condemned by the Judges, and being drawn thence by the Heels to the <hi>Elms</hi> in <hi>East-Smithfield,</hi> he was there hanged. In 1214. King <hi>John</hi> writ to <hi>Jeffery Magnaville</hi> to deliver the Tower of <hi>London</hi> with the Pri≈øoners, Armour, and all other things found therein belonging to the King, to <hi>William</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Huntington.</hi> In the fir≈øt of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. 1216. the Tower was delivered to <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>Franse,</hi> and the Barons of <hi>England.</hi> In 1206 Pleas of the Crown were pleaded in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and divers times afterward.

                  <p>In 1244, <hi>Griffith</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> being a Pri≈øoner in the Tower, attempted an e≈øcape, and having in the night tyed the Sheets, and hangings together he endeavoured thereby to ≈ølide from the top of the High Tower, but being a Fat man the weight of his Body brake the Rope, and he fell; The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56661:18"/>he was found dead, his head and neck being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into his Brea≈øt between the Shoulders.

                  <p>In 1263, As the Queen was going by water from the Tower toward <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> ≈øeveral Citizens got together upon <hi>London Bridge,</hi> under which ≈øhe was to pa≈øs, who not only u≈øed reproachful words again≈øt her, but threw ≈øtones and dirt at her, forcing her to go back again, but in 1265. they were forced to ≈øubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to the King for it, and the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Sheriffs were ≈øent to ≈øeveral Pri≈øons; <hi>Othon,</hi> Con≈øtable of the Tower, being made <hi>Cu≈øtos,</hi> or keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the City.</p>
                  <p>About this time, <hi>Leoline</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> came down from the Mountain of <hi>Snowdon</hi> to <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and was taken at <hi>Bluith</hi> Ca≈øtle, where u≈øing reproachful words again≈øt the <hi>Engli≈øh, Roger le Strange</hi> fell upon him, and with his own ≈øword cut off his head, leaving his dead body on the Ground; Sir <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> cau≈øed this Head to be ≈øet upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> crowned with a wreath of Ivy; And this was the end of <hi>Leoline,</hi> who was betrayed by the Men of <hi>Bluith,</hi> and was the la≈øt Prince of the <hi>Britti≈øh</hi> bloud who Ruled in <hi>Wales.</hi>

                  <p>In 1290, Several Judges as well of the Kings Bench as the A≈ø≈øize, were ≈øent Pri≈øoners to the Tower, and with great Sums of Money obtained their Liberty; Sir <hi>Thomas Weyland</hi> had all his E≈øtate confi≈øcated, and him≈øelf bani≈øhed; Sir <hi>Ralph Hengham</hi> Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice of the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> paid 7000 Marks; Sir <hi>John Lovet</hi> Cheif Ju≈øtice of the Lower Bench 3000 Marks.

                  <p>In the 14 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2.

The Kings Ju≈øtices ≈øate in the Tower, for Trial of divers matters, at which time <hi>John Gi≈ø≈øors,</hi> late Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and ≈øeveral others fled to the City, for fear of being charged with things they had pre≈øumptuou≈øly done.

                  <p>In 1326. The Citizens of <hi>London</hi> took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Tower, and taking away the keys from the Con≈øtable, they di≈øcharged all the Pri≈øoners, and kept both the City and Tower for the u≈øe of Queen <hi>I≈øabel</hi> and her ≈øon <hi>Edward,</hi> (who was afterward <hi>Edw.</hi> the III.)</p>
                  <p>In 1330, <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> was taken, and committed to the Tower, from whence he was drawn to the Elmes, and their hanged on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gallows, where he hung two days and two nights by the Kings Command, and was then buried in the <hi>Gray Friers</hi> Church; This Earl was condemned by his Peers, and yet was never brought to make his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before them.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56661:19"/>Farmers or Commi≈ø≈øioners, met in ≈øeveral Places in <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> where they levied this Tax of Groats, or Polemoney, with all manner of ≈øeverity, which ≈øo di≈øcontented the People, that they combined together, and re≈øi≈øted the Collectors, killing ≈øome, wounding others, and making the re≈øt fly.</p>
                  <p>The Tumult began fir≈øt in <hi>Kent,</hi> upon this occa≈øion, (as it is related in the Chronicles of St. <hi>Albans</hi>) One of the≈øe Exactors coming to the Hou≈øe of <hi>John</hi> (others ≈øay) <hi>Wat Tyler,</hi> living at <hi>Dartford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> demanded of <hi>Tylers</hi> Wife, a Groat a piece for her Husband, her ≈øelf, and Servants, and likewi≈øe for a young Maiden her Daughter; The woman paid for all but her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, alleaging ≈øhe was a Child, and underage to pay; <hi>That will I ≈øoon know,</hi> (quoth the Collector) and ≈øhamefully turned the young Maids Coats up, to ≈øee whether ≈øhe were come to ripene≈øs of Age; (the≈øe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains having in divers other Places made the like ba≈øe; and uncivil Trials.) Hereupon the Mother crying out, divers of the Neighbours came in, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band being at work in the Town, tyling a hou≈øe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, taking his Lathing-≈øtaff in his hand, ran home, and finding the Collector, asked him, who made him ≈øo bold? the Collector returned ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ≈øtruck at <hi>Tyler,</hi> who avoiding the blow, gave the Collector ≈øuch a home-blow with his Lathing-≈øtaff, that his Brains flew out of his head; which made a great uproar in the Streets, and the People being glad at what had happened, they prepared to defend and ≈øtand by <hi>Tyler.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thereupon a great number of them being got together, they went from thence to <hi>Maid≈øtone,</hi> and then to <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> per≈øwading, and Exhorting all the People as they marched along to join with them in this common Cau≈øe, and ≈øetting Guards upon all the ways to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> they ≈øtopped all Pa≈ø≈øengers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them to ≈øwear; <hi>That they would keep Allegiance to King</hi> Richard, <hi>and to the Commons; That they would

                  </p>
                  <p>There joyned with them one <hi>John Ball</hi> a factious Clergyman, who took occa≈øion to rip up the grounds of the Mi≈ø-government, telling the People, <hi>That this difference of Mens E≈øtates, where ≈øome were Potentates, and others Bondmen, was again≈øt Christian Liberty,</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his Text this old Rhyme,

                  <p>This ≈øo incen≈øed the Commons that their Number daily increa≈øed, ≈øo that when they were come as far as <hi>Blackheath,</hi> they were e≈øteemed to be an Hundred Thou≈øand, ≈øo that fearing no re≈øi≈øtance, they began to commit all manner of Violence, ≈øparing none whom they thought to be learned e≈øpecially if they found a pen or Inkhorn about him, for then they pull'd off his Hood, and with one Voice cryed out, <hi>Hale him out, and cut off his head.</hi> The King ≈øent ≈øome Knights to them to know the cau≈øe of their A≈ø≈øembling, To whom they an≈øwered, <hi>That for certain Cau≈øes they were come together, and de≈øired to talk with the King, and therefore willed the Knights to tell him, That he must needs come to them, that he might understand the de≈øire of their Hearts.</hi> The King was advi≈øed by ≈øome to go pre≈øently to them, but <hi>Simon Sudbury</hi> Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Lord Chancellor, and <hi>Robert Hales</hi> of St. <hi>Johns,</hi> Trea≈øurer, affirmed, <hi>That it was not fit for the King to go to ≈øuch a rude Company, but rather to take Order to ≈øuppre≈øs them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This the Commons hearing, were ≈øo enraged, that they ≈øwore, <hi>They would go ≈øeek the Kings Traytors, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56661:20"/>cut off their beads;</hi> And thereupon they marched into <hi>Southwark,</hi> and ruined the Archbi≈øhops Palace at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> out of ≈øpight to him. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen fearing they would do the like to the City, ordered the Gates to be ≈øhut, but the Commoners of the City, e≈øpecially the Poorer ≈øort, favouring the Commoners of the Countrey, threatned death to all that ≈øhould attempt it; So that the Rebels had free Egre≈øs, and Regre≈øs in and out of <hi>London,</hi> and dayly incouraged the Citizens to favour their Cau≈øe, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Their Purpo≈øe was only to bring the Traytors of the Land to Ju≈øtice, and then they would lay down their Arms;</hi> And hereby they won them to ≈øtand by them.</p>
                  <p>The fir≈øt thing they did when they came to <hi>London</hi> was to ≈øend for one <hi>Richard Lyon</hi> a Grave Citizen, who had been <hi>Tylers</hi> Ma≈øter, and having ≈øtruck off his head, they carried it upon a Pole in Triumph before them. The next day they came to the <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancasters</hi> Hou≈øe, which they ≈øet on fire, burning all his rich Furniture, breaking in peices all his Plate and Jewels, and throwing them into the <hi>Thames,</hi> ≈øaying, <hi>They were men of Ju≈øtice, and would not like Robbers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them≈øelves with any mans Goods, for they only were for destroying Traytors;</hi> And when one of their Fellows was e≈øpied to thru≈øt a fair piece of Silver into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom, they took him, and ca≈øt both him and it into the Fire; neither took they any thing from any man but at the ju≈øt price. Two and thirty of them were got into the <hi>Dukes</hi> Wine-cellar, where they ≈øtayed drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øo long, till the Rafters of the Hou≈øe, which was on Fire, fell upon them, and ≈øo covered them, that not able to get out, they were heard cry ≈øeven days after, and then peri≈øhed.</p>
                  <p>From the <hi>Savoy</hi> they went to the <hi>Temple</hi> where they burnt the Lawyers Chambers, with their Books, and Writings, and all they could lay hands on. Al≈øo the Noble Hou≈øe of St. <hi>Johns,</hi> by <hi>Smithfield</hi> they ≈øet on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56661:21"/>Fire, which burnt for ≈øeven days together, not ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any to quench it, And likewi≈øe the Mannor of <hi>Highbury,</hi> and other Places belonging to St. <hi>Johns.</hi> After this they came to the Tower, where King <hi>Richard</hi> lodged, and ≈øent to command him, <hi>To come to them, without delay, unarmed, and without any Guard, which if he refu≈øed, they would pull down the Tower, and be ≈øhould not e≈øcape alive.</hi> The King finding no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy though he had 600 Armed Men, and as many Archers about him, yet dur≈øt not but ≈øuffer them to enter, ≈øo that in great fear the King went toward them on Hor≈øeback, his own Guards ≈øtanding as men amazed. Being come into the Tower, the≈øe Ru≈øticks pre≈øumed to enter into the King, and his Mothers Chambers with their Weapons, and laid them≈øelves on the Kings bed, ≈øporting and playing thereon, yea they abu≈øed the Kings Mother, offering to ki≈øs her in ≈øuch a rude manner that ≈øhe fell into a Swound.</p>
                  <p>They then proceeded with Rage and Fury to ≈øearch for the Arch-bi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and finding one of his Servants, charged him to bring them to the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor his Ma≈øter; the Servant being afraid brought them to the Chappel where his Ma≈øter was at Prayers, who being aware of their coming had continued there all night; and when he heard they were come, he ≈øaid with great con≈øtancy to his Servants, <hi>Let us now go, ≈øurely it is be≈øt to dye, when it is no plea≈øure to live;</hi> Upon which the Rabble cryed, <hi>Where is the Traytor?</hi> who an≈øwered, <hi>I am the Archbi≈øhop whom you ≈øeek, not a Traytor.</hi> Whereupon they dragged him out of the Chappel to <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> where being incompa≈ø≈øed with many Thou≈øands, and ≈øeeing many drawn ≈øwords about his head he ≈øaid,</p>

                     <p>At the ≈øame time when we were A≈ø≈øembled upon <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> and had ≈øent to the King to come to us, our purpo≈øe was to have ≈ølain all ≈øuch Knights, E≈øquires and Gentlemen as attended him; And for the King, we would have kept him among≈øt us, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might have more boldly repaired to us, ≈øince they would have thought that whatever we did, was by his Authority; Finally when we had got ≈øtrength enough, ≈øo as not to fear any attempt made again≈øt us, we would have ≈ølain all ≈øuch Noblemen, as ≈øhould either have given Coun≈øel, or made Re≈øi≈øtance again≈øt us, but e≈øpecially we would have ≈ølain all the Knights of the <hi>Rhodes</hi> or St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeru≈øalem;</hi> and la≈øtly we would have killed the King him≈øelf, and all men of E≈øtates, with Bi≈øhops, Monks, Canons, and Par≈øons of Churches; Only we would have ≈øaved <hi>Friers Mendicants</hi> for Mini≈øtring the Sacraments to us.</p>
                     <p>When we had been rid of all the≈øe, we would have devi≈øed Laws, according to which the Subjects of this Realm ≈øhould have lived; For we would have created Kings, as <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and others in other Countreys; But becau≈øe this our purpo≈øe was di≈øappointed by the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who would not permit the King to come to us, we ≈øought by all means to di≈øpatch him out of the way, as at length we did; And further, the ≈øame Evening that <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> was killed, we were re≈øolved (having the greate≈øt part of the Commons of the City inclined to join with us) to have ≈øet Fire in four corners of the City and ≈øo to have devided among our ≈øelves the Spoil of the chiefe≈øt Riches that could have been found; And this (≈øaid he) was our purpo≈øe, as God may help me now at my la≈øt end.</p>

                  <p>After this Confe≈ø≈øion he was beheaded and his head was ≈øet on <hi>London Bridge</hi> by <hi>Wat Tylers;</hi> And thus by the happy and pro≈øperous ≈øucce≈øs at <hi>London,</hi> this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Rebellion was fully quieted.</p>

                  <p>In 1392. and the Fifteenth of <hi>Richard</hi> II. there happened ≈øome difference between that King and the <hi>Londoners;</hi> One occa≈øion was, that the King would have borrowed of them a thou≈øand pound, but they feeling much and fearing more the Kings daily Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only refu≈øed it, but abu≈øed a certain <hi>Italian</hi> Merchant who would have laid down the Money. Another occa≈øion was, That one of the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisburies</hi> Servants named <hi>Walter Roman</hi> taking an Hou≈øe Loaf out of a Bakers basket in the Streets, ran with it into the Bi≈øhops Hou≈øe; The Citizens demanded the delivery of the Offender, but the Bi≈øhops men ≈øhut the Gates, and would not ≈øuffer the Con≈øtable to enter, upon which many people got together, threatning to break open the Gates, and Fire the Hou≈øe unle≈øs <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> were brought forth; <hi>What</hi> (≈øaid they) <hi>are the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops men Priviledged? or is his hou≈øe a Sanctuary? or will he protect tho≈øe whom he ought to puni≈øh? if we may be abu≈øed in this manner, not only our Streets, but our Shops and Hou≈øes ≈øhall never be free from violence, and wrong, this we neither will, nor can endure, for it doth not become us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hereupon they approached the Gates with great Fury; But the Lord Mayor, and Sheriffs having notice hereof, came to them and told them; <hi>That this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus partly by per≈øwa≈øion, and partly by their Pre≈øence and Authority, they ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed the Riot and ≈øent every man home, with ≈øtrict charge to keep the Peace. Hitherto there was no great mi≈øcheif done, and the quarrel might have been ended without any further trouble, had not the Bi≈øhops ≈øtirred in it, and kindled the Coals of Contention afre≈øh.

                  <p>Whereupon <hi>John Waltham</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and Lord Trea≈øurer of <hi>England,</hi> made a grievous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint again≈øt them for this la≈øt Attempt to <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Archbi≈øhop of <hi>York,</hi> and Lord Chancellor; alledging, <hi>That if upon every ≈ølight pretence, the Citizens ≈øhould be ≈øuffered in this manner, to affront the Bi≈øhops without reproof, or puni≈øhment, they would endanger not only the Dignity and State, but the Liberty of the whole Church al≈øo; For</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>did they not lately take upon them the puni≈øhment of Adulteries, and other Crimes apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Eccle≈øia≈øtical Juri≈ødiction, maliciou≈øly alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That either the Bi≈øhops and their Officers were infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for tho≈øe Vices them≈øelves, and did therefore Connive at the ≈øame in others; Or el≈øe by Covetous Commutation and taking of Money, did rather ≈øet tho≈øe ≈øins to Sale, than endeavour carefully to ≈øuppre≈øs them.

                  </p>
                  <p>Armed with the≈øe furious Arguments, they went together to King <hi>Richard,</hi> and ≈øo incen≈øed him again≈øt the <hi>Londoners,</hi> (his Mind being before prepared by former Provocations) that he was once re≈øolved to have utterly ruined, and de≈øtroyed the whole City;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56661:27"/>But being per≈øwaded to u≈øe more Moderation, he in Revenge, fir≈øt cau≈øed the Lord Maior, Sheriffs, and many of the Principal Citizens to be committed to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pri≈øons, the Lord Mayor to <hi>Wind≈øor</hi> Ca≈øtle, and others to other Places; and then ≈øeized the Liberties of the City into his hands declaring, that no Lord Mayor ≈øhould for the future be Elected any more, but that the King ≈øhould at his Plea≈øure appoint a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or Governour over the City. And this Office was fir≈øt committed to Sir <hi>Edward Darlington,</hi> who for his kindne≈øs toward the City was ≈øoon removed, and Sir <hi>Baldwin Radington</hi> put in his place.</p>
                  <p>The King was likewi≈øe per≈øwaded by <hi>Arundel</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhop of <hi>York</hi> to remove the Terms and Courts, that is, the <hi>Chancery, Exchequer, Kings Bench,</hi> the <hi>Hamper</hi> Office and the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> where they continued from <hi>Mid≈øummer</hi> 1393. till <hi>Chri≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> next following, to the great dammage, and lo≈øs of the City of <hi>London;</hi> But at la≈øt upon the earne≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of the Dukes of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the King ≈øent for the <hi>Londoners</hi> before him to <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> where having fir≈øt terrified them with the ≈øight of a great Number of Souldiers, he cau≈øed all the Priviledges and Charters of the City, both old, and new to be produced, ≈øome of which he re≈øtored to them, and detained others. Yet were not the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens received fully into favour, neither did they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Per≈øon or Dignity of their Lord Mayor at that time.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after the King went to <hi>London,</hi> at who≈øe coming the Citizens turned all their Greif into Joy (the Vulgar being without mea≈øure in both) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him with ≈øuch joyful Triumphs, and Rich Pre≈øents, as if it had been the day of his Coronation, thinking by all the≈øe co≈øtly preparations, to have paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all former Anger, and di≈øplea≈øure again≈øt them, but they found them≈øelves much deceived, there being no Reconciliation to be made without Money; for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56661:28"/>they were not ab≈øolutely re≈øtored to their Liberties till they had paid Ten Thou≈øand pound to the King as a Fine. Thus did the <hi>Londoners</hi> ≈øhew a ≈øtrange diver≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Di≈øpo≈øition, in ra≈øhly committing an Offence, and patiently induring puni≈øhment, yet upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as ≈øoon as the fir≈øt occa≈øion was offered again≈øt King <hi>Richard</hi> they ≈øhewed them≈øelves either his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt Enemies, or faint Friends, as by the ≈øequel ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.</p>
                  <p>In 1387. King <hi>Richard</hi> II. held his Fea≈øt of <hi>Chri≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> in the Tower of <hi>London;</hi> And in the year 1399, the ≈øame King was ≈øent Pri≈øoner to the Tower, which being a very remarkable Tran≈øaction, it may be nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary to give a breif Account thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> the II. was the only Son of a Renowned Father, <hi>Edward</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> who died before his Father, <hi>Edward</hi> III. and thereupon <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> was by his Grandfather in his Life-time, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his Heir and lawful Succe≈ø≈øor, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his Death was Crowned King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter, July</hi> 16. 1377. But being of tender age, only eleven years old, ≈øeveral Per≈øons were commi≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to be his Protectors, or Guardians; and ≈øoon after a Parliament was called at <hi>Westminster,</hi> wherein <hi>Alice Peirce</hi> the late Kings Concubine, was bani≈øhed, and all her Goods Confi≈øcate; and two Tenths of the Clergy, and two Fifteenths of the Temporality were granted, but ≈øo as that two Citizens of <hi>London, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Walworth,</hi> and <hi>John Philpot</hi> ≈øhould receive, and keep it, to ≈øee it be≈øtowed for defence of the Realm. At which time Sir <hi>Hugh Calverly</hi> Deputy of <hi>Callice,</hi> burnt 26 <hi>French</hi> Ships in the Haven of <hi>Bulloigne;</hi> But one <hi>Mercer,</hi> a <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Pyrate came to <hi>Scarborough,</hi> and took divers Ships, committing likewi≈øe many Outrages, and no Order being taken to repel them, <hi>John Philpot</hi> ≈øet out a Fleet at his own Charge, and encountring him in his own Per≈øon, took <hi>Mercer</hi> and all his Ships, and returning home, in≈øtead of being rewarded for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56661:28"/>his Service, he was que≈øtioned for pre≈øuming to fit out a Navy without Advice of the Kings Council.</p>
                  <p>While the King was in his Minority matters were carried indifferent well, but in the year 1387, King <hi>Richard</hi> begins to enter, as we may ≈øay, upon the Confines of his De≈øtiny; His Gracing of unde≈øerving Men, and Di≈øgracing of Men de≈øerving, if they were not the Cau≈øes, were at lea≈øt the occa≈øions of his own Di≈øgracing; He was now come to be of full Age to do all him≈øelf, which was indeed to be of full Age to undo him≈øelf, for the Errors of his younger years might be excu≈øed by inexperience, but the faults of the Age he was now of, admit of no Apology, nor defence; And to ha≈øten his de≈øtiny the ≈øooner, the Evil Coun≈øel which was formerly but whi≈øpered in his Ear, they now had the Confidence to give him aloud; For it was told him, <hi>That he was under Tuition no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and therefore not to be controlled as formerly he had been; That to be cro≈øt of his will by his Subjects, was to be their Subject; That he is no Soveraign, if he be not Ab≈øolute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the in≈øtigation of ≈øuch Coun≈øellors as the≈øe, the King in a Parliament then A≈ø≈øembled fell to expo≈øtulate with the Lords, asking them, <hi>What years they thought him to be of;</hi> who an≈øwering, <hi>That he was ≈øomewhat more than one and Twenty; Well then,</hi> (≈øaid he) <hi>I am out of your Ward≈øhip, and expect to enjoy my Kingdom as freely as you your ≈øelves at the like years enjoy your Patrimonies.</hi> But (≈øaith our Author) his flattering Favourites ≈øhould have remembred, that though the King may not be controlled where he can command, yet he may be oppo≈øed where he can but demand; as now indeed he was, For when he demanded a Sub≈øidy toward his Wars, He was an≈øwered, <hi>That he needed no Sub≈øidy from his Subjects, if he would but call in the debts that the Chancellor owed him; and if he were ≈øo tender, that he could not do that work him≈øelf, they would do it for him;</hi> And thereupon charged him with ≈øuch Crimes,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56661:29"/>that all his Goods were Confi≈øcate, and him≈øelf adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dye if the King plea≈øed. Though others write, his Sentence was only to pay twenty Thou≈øand Marks as a Fine, and a Thou≈øand pound be≈øides yearly.</p>
                  <p>This Chancellor was <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> a Merchants Son, who was lately made Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> who with <hi>Robert Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> and Marque≈øs of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ≈øome others, were King <hi>Richards</hi> bo≈øom Favourites; And upon this Provocation given them, they pre≈øently ≈øtudy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; And thereupon contrive, that the Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> (the Kings Uncle) as Principal, and other Lords who cro≈ø≈øed the Kings Cour≈øes, ≈øhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to a ≈øupper in <hi>London,</hi> and be there Murdered; In the Execution of which Plot, the late Lord Mayor, Sir <hi>Nicholas Brember,</hi> was deeply concerned, but the pre≈øent Lord Mayor, <hi>Richard Exton,</hi> though moved thereto by the King him≈øelf, utterly refu≈øed to do it, and thereupon this De≈øign mi≈øcarried.</p>
                  <p>But notwith≈øtanding the≈øe heats, and many more, which pa≈ø≈øed in this Parliament, yet a Sub≈øidy was at la≈øt granted to the King of half a Tenth, and half a Fifteenth, but with this expre≈øs Condition, that it ≈øhould not be paid out, but by order from the Lords, and the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> was to receive it; But before this time, it was ab≈øolutely agreed between both Hou≈øes of Parliament, <hi>That unle≈øs the Chancellor were removed they would proceed no further;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King having notice hereof, ≈øent a Me≈ø≈øage to the Hou≈øe of Commons that they ≈øhould ≈øend to <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> where he then lay, Forty of their Hou≈øe, to declare their Minds to him; But upon a Conference between both Hou≈øes, it was agreed, That the Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Arundel</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Ely</hi> ≈øhould in the name of the Parliament go to him; who coming to the King, declared. <hi>That by an old Statute the King once a year might lawfully ≈øummon his Court of Parliament for Reformation of all Enormities and Corruptions within
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56661:29"/>the Realm;</hi> and further declared, <hi>That by an Old Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it was likewi≈øe Enacted, That if the King ≈øhould ab≈øent him≈øelf Forty days not being ≈øick, the Hou≈øes might lawfully break up, and return home;</hi> At which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the King ≈øhould ≈øay, <hi>Well, we perceive our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple go about to ri≈øe against us, and therefore we think we cannot do better, then to ask aid of our Cou≈øen the King of</hi> France, <hi>and rather ≈øubmit our ≈øelves to him, than to our own Subjects.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the Lords an≈øwered, <hi>They wondred at his Maje≈øties Opinion, ≈øince the</hi> French <hi>King was the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Enemy of the Kingdom, and he might remember what mi≈øchiefs were brought upon the Realm in King</hi> Johns <hi>time by ≈øuch Cour≈øes.</hi> By the≈øe and the like per≈øwa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the King was induced to come to his Parliament, wherein <hi>John Fordham,</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Durham</hi> is di≈øcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Office of Trea≈øurer, and <hi>Michael de la Pool</hi> of being Chancellor, and others by con≈øent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment put in their places; Likewi≈øe by Order of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, thirteen Lords were appointed under the King to have over≈øight of the whole Government of the Realm, that is the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Ely</hi> Lord Chancellor; Bi≈øhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> Lord Trea≈øurer, the Abbot of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> Lord Privy Seal, the Archbi≈øhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Glocester,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but this divi≈øion of the Government was ≈øoon found inconvenient; This Parliament al≈øo granted to <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> (lately created Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi>) thirty Thou≈øand Marks (which the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> were to give to the heirs of <hi>Charles de Bloys</hi>) upon Condition that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ea≈øter following he ≈øhould go over into <hi>Ireland;</hi> So de≈øirous were the Lords, and Commons to have him removed from the Kings pre≈øence.</p>
                  <p>But though the King gave way to this Torrent of the Parliament at pre≈øent, yet as ≈øoon as they were Di≈ø≈øolved, he di≈ø≈øolved likewi≈øe all they had done again≈øt his Favourites, and received them into more Favour than before.

                  <p>The King having remained ≈øome time in tho≈øe Parts had quite forgotten the Voyage of the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ≈øo brought him back with him again to <hi>Nottingham</hi> Ca≈øtle.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56661:31"/>Armour or Furniture of War under a great penalty.</p>
                  <p>After this the King is per≈øwaded to ≈øend to the Lords to come to him to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> upon Oath given by the Arch-bi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Chancellor that no fraud nor evil practice ≈øhould be u≈øed again≈øt them, which the Lords were content to do, but when they were ready to come, they under≈øtood there was an Ambu≈øh laid to intrap them of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand men in the <hi>Mews;</hi> which the King ab≈øolutely denied he had any knowledge of; yet the Lords after this receiving a ≈øafe Conduct from the King, came to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> of who≈øe coming when the King heard, he apparelled him≈øelf in his Royal Robes, and with his Scepter in his hand came into the Great Hall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the Lords upon their Knees pre≈øented them≈øelves, the King bidding them welcome, and taking each of them by the hand.</p>
                  <p>Then the Lord Chancellor made a Speech wherein he blamed them for rai≈øing Arms, de≈øiring to know the Cau≈øe; who an≈øwered, <hi>They had done it for the good of the Kingdom, and to remove the Traytors about the King;</hi> Upon which the King him≈øelf ≈øpoke and asked them whether they thought to compel him by ≈øtrong hand? <hi>Have not I</hi> (≈øaith he) <hi>≈øufficient power to beat you down? truly in this behalf, I make no more account of you than of the ba≈øe≈øt Skullion in my Kitchen.</hi> Yet after the≈øe great words, he lift up the Duke of <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> who all this while was kneeling, and commanded the re≈øt al≈øo to ri≈øe, and then led them Courteou≈øly to his Chamber, where they ≈øate and drank together, and at la≈øt it was concluded they ≈øhould all meet again, as well the≈øe Lords, as tho≈øe they accu≈øed at the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which the King promi≈øed he would ≈øpeedily call, and each party to receive there according to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, and in the mean while all Parties ≈øhould be under the Kings Protection.</p>
                  <p>But when the Favourite Lords heard this, they told the King plainly they neither dur≈øt nor would put
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56661:32"/>them≈øelves to the hazard of ≈øuch a Meeting, and therefore the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the re≈øt of that Faction left the Court to be out of the way; but the King not enduring their ab≈øence appointed <hi>Thomas Molineux,</hi> Con≈øtable of the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Che≈øter</hi> to rai≈øe an Army, and to ≈øafe conduct the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> to his pre≈øence; But they being come as far as <hi>Radcoat</hi> Bridge, were encountred by the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> not daring to joyn battel with him fled, and being to pa≈øs a River, ca≈øt away his Gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and ≈øword to be more nimble, and ≈øpurring his Hor≈øe lept into the River and ≈øo e≈øcaped; though it was reported he was drowned, till news came he was got into <hi>Holland,</hi> where being no welcome Gue≈øt he wandred up and down two or three years, like a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, and at <hi>Lorain</hi> in <hi>Brabant</hi> ended his life.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Lords had got matter enough again≈øt the King, at lea≈øt to ju≈øtifie their Arms, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with an Army of Forty thou≈øand men they came to <hi>London,</hi> where after ≈øome debate, they were received, and ≈øome of them went to the Tower to the King, to whom after humble Salutations, they ≈øhewed the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he had written to the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> to levy an Army for their de≈øtruction; likewi≈øe the Letters which the <hi>French</hi> King had written to him, containing a ≈øafe Conduct for him to come into <hi>France,</hi> there to do Acts to his own di≈øhonour, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                  <p>After which upon the Kings Promi≈øe that he would come the next day to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> to treat further of the≈øe matters, the Lords departed, only at the Kings de≈øire the Earls of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Derby</hi> ≈øtayed all Night, but before the King went to bed, his Mind was quite altered as to keeping promi≈øe with the Lords, which they under≈øtanding, ≈øent peremptorily to him, <hi>That if be came not according to his Word, they would chu≈øe another King who ≈øhould hearken to the faithful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel of his Lords.</hi> This touched the King to the quick,

A General Pardon was al≈øo granted for all the Kings Subjects but only to Fifty; who≈øe names he would not Expre≈øs, but re≈øerved them to him≈øelf, that when any of the Nobility offended him, he might at his Plea≈øure name him to be one of the number excepted, and ≈øo keep them ≈øtill within his danger.

                  <p>And now the Heads of the Oppo≈øite Faction having lo≈øt their Heads, and all things as well ≈øetled as could be de≈øired, the King was ≈øecure as thinking him≈øelf ≈øafe, and he had been indeed ≈øafe, if Time and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune were not Actors in Revenge as well as men, or rather if a Superiour Power did not interpo≈øe, who≈øe ways are as ≈øecret as him≈øelf is invincible.

                  <p>Sir <hi>Piers</hi> having thus ≈ølain the King, wept bitterly, and a great part of this prophetical Speech came to pa≈øs in a ≈øhort time after; King <hi>Richard</hi> thus dead his Body was imbalmed and covered with Lead all ≈øave his Face, and then brought to <hi>London</hi> where it lay in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church three days unburied, that all might ≈øee he was dead.

                  </p>
                  <p>In 1458 there were Ju≈øts and Turnaments in the Tower; In 1478. The Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Butt of Malm≈øey within the Tower; <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Wife to King <hi>Henry</hi> 7. Dyed in the Tower in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed 1502. In the year 1512, the Chappel in the High <hi>White Tower</hi> was burnt; Queen <hi>Ann Bullein</hi> was beheaded in the Tower 1541, and a little after <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine Howard</hi> both Wives to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight. In the year 1546 a ≈øtrange accident happened in the Tower, for one <hi>Foxly</hi> who was Potmaker for the Mint, falling a ≈øleep could not be awakened by pinching, beating or burning, for fourteen days; at which time he awaked as fre≈øh as the fir≈øt day he began to ≈øleep.</p>
                  <p>In King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time, the Tower was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten full of Pri≈øoners, and among others Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> who was kept clo≈øe Pri≈øoner, and at la≈øt they took from him all his Books, whereupon he ≈øhut up his Pri≈øon Windows, and lived in Darkne≈øs; and being asked the rea≈øon, he an≈øwered, <hi>it is time to ≈øhut up Shop when the Wares are all gone;</hi> At his fir≈øt entrance into the Tower, the Gentleman Porter demanded his Fee, which is the upper Garment, whereupon Sr. <hi>Thomas</hi> pulled off his Cap to give it him, but that not ≈øufficing, he pulled out an handfull of Angels, and gave him a good many, a Knight that was in his Company tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that he was glad to ≈øee him have ≈øo many Angels, <hi>Yes</hi> (an≈øwered he,) <hi>I love to carry my Friends always about me.</hi> Not long after the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> was beheaded there, and upon the Scaffold, ≈øhe made a mo≈øt ingenious Speech full of Pity, <hi>That ≈øhe came thither to ≈øerve for an Example to Po≈øterity, that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence cannot be any Protection against Greatne≈øs; and

                  </p>
                  <p>In King <hi>James</hi> his time, there was no Blood ≈øpilt in the Tower, or upon Towerhill, only Sir <hi>Gerva≈øe Elways</hi> was hanged there when he was Lieutenant about the Murder of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> and one remarkable pa≈ø≈øage there was in his Speech upon the Ladder, <hi>That being in the Low-Countreys, and much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Gaming, he made a ≈øerious wi≈øh that if ever he played more above ≈øuch a ≈øum, he might be hanged, but he Violated the Oath, and ≈øo the just Judgment of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fell upon him according to his words.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Castle haven</hi> in the year 1631, was brought from the Tower to be Executed for Horrid Crimes; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others ≈øince, have been Executed there, as the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Arch-Bi≈øhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and many more.</p>
                  <p>This ≈øtately Tower ≈øerves not only for a Goal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pri≈øoners, but for many other u≈øes, it is a ≈øtrong Fort, or Citadel, which ≈øecures both City and River. It is the Trea≈øury of the Jewels and Ornaments of the Crown; It con≈øerves all the Old Records of the Courts of Ju≈øtice at <hi>We≈øtminster,</hi> it is the place for the Royal Mint, and the Coynage of Gold and Silver, it is the chief Magazine and Armory of the whole Land for Martial Engines and Provi≈øion, and there only is the <hi>Brahe</hi> or <hi>Rack,</hi> u≈øually called the Duke of <hi>Exeters</hi> Daughter, becau≈øe he was the fir≈øt Inventor of it, and La≈øtly it is a great Ornament, by the ≈øitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it, both to the River and City.</p>
                  <p>This City hath had divers other Towns be≈øides; one at the North End of <hi>London-Bridge,</hi> which is now utterly demoli≈øhed, and the other at the South End, which hath ≈øuffered many Accidents of Fireing, and otherwi≈øe, and was ≈øtill repaired at the charge of the City. Upon this Gate the Heads of Traytors are commonly placed, and ≈øome there are thereon at this day. Hi≈øtorians mention two Ca≈øtles that were
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56661:38"/>built in the We≈øt part of the City, one called the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Montfiquet,</hi> built by a Lord of that name, which is now demoli≈øhed, and the <hi>Black Fryers</hi> ro≈øe up in≈øtead of it, the other called <hi>Baynards Ca≈øtle</hi> from one <hi>Baynard,</hi> who≈øe Family long enjoyed it, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Robert Fitz-Walter</hi> who was called Banner Bearer of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and had great Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. This Ca≈øtle fell afterwards to the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> who was Crowned there by the Title of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, to whom this City always ≈øtuck very clo≈øe, but in the Seventh Year of his Reign many of the greate≈øt men in <hi>London</hi> were accu≈øed of High Trea≈øon, and divers Aldermen, whereof they were acquitted, yet did they forfeit their Goods to the value of Forty Thou≈øand Marks, and among them Sr. <hi>Thomas Cook</hi> formerly Lord Mayor, without <hi>Hawkins</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Tower, neither could be di≈øcharged without paying Eight Thou≈øand Marks to the King. <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh repaired <hi>Baynards Ca≈øtle,</hi> and rid through the City in State with all the Knights of the Garter, from the Tower to St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church, where they heard Ma≈øs, and Lodged that Night at <hi>Baynards Castle,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was likewi≈øe proclaimed at <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards Castle,</hi> though the Lady <hi>Jane</hi> had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a little before.</p>
                  <p>There was al≈øo another Tower or Ca≈øtle near <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards Ca≈øtle,</hi> but there is now no ≈øign of it remaining; And another in the place where <hi>Bridewell</hi> now ≈øtands, which being demoli≈øhed, yet there was a Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace left where the Kings of <hi>England</hi> kept their Courts, and King <hi>John</hi> ≈øummoned a Parliament there; and afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight repaired it, and made it much more ≈øtately for the entertainment of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Charles</hi> the Fift Emperour, and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who in the year 1522 was Magnificently Treated there.</p>
                  <p>There was another Tower called the <hi>Tower Royal,</hi> where King <hi>Stephen</hi> kept his Court; <hi>Barbican</hi> was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56661:38"/>likewi≈øe another Tower; There was another called <hi>Sernes Tower</hi> in <hi>Bucklersbury,</hi> where we read <hi>Edward</hi> the III. kept his Court, and gave it afterward to his free Chappel of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> in <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> now called <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øevenths Chappel, who ≈øpent fourteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand pound in building of it, and about the ≈øame time he built a Great Ship which co≈øt ju≈øt ≈øo much.

                  <p>IN former times before <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, and long after, the City was watered (be≈øides the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous River of <hi>Thames</hi> in the South) with the River of <hi>Wells,</hi> as it was then called; and in the We≈øt with a water called <hi>Walbrook,</hi> running through the mid≈øt of the City into the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> There was al≈øo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Water which ran within the City through <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourn</hi> Ward, watering that part in the Ea≈øt; There were three Principal Fountains or Wells in the other Suburbs, that is <hi>Holywell, Clements Well,</hi> and <hi>Clarkes Well;</hi> and near to the la≈øt were divers other Wells; as <hi>Skinners Well, Fogs Well, Todewell,</hi> and <hi>Radwell,</hi> all which flowing into the River afore-mentioned, much increa≈øed the ≈øtream, and gave it the name of <hi>Wells.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is recorded that in <hi>We≈øt-Smithfield</hi> there was a

Since which time for the Conveniency and enlargement of the Streets, and likewi≈øe by rea≈øon of the new River Water, contrived by Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> mo≈øt of the≈øe Conduits are taken down, and removed.</p>
                  <p>For Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having before granted to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> by Act of Parliament Liberty for cutting and conveying a River from any part of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle≈øex</hi> or <hi>Hertford≈øhire</hi> to the City of <hi>London</hi> with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of Ten years time, her life ended before any would undertake it; whereupon the like Act was pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed by King <hi>James,</hi> but without Date of time, and when all others refu≈øed it, Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to bring a River from <hi>Chadwell</hi> and <hi>Amwell,</hi> to the North≈øide of <hi>London</hi> near <hi>I≈ølington,</hi> where he built a large Ci≈øtern to receive it.

               <p>In the Year 1066. <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour landed at <hi>Pem≈øey</hi> in <hi>Su≈ø≈øex,</hi> and immediately ≈øent a Me≈ø≈øenger to King <hi>Harold</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> whereby he claimed no le≈øs than the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> upon pretence of a Donation from King <hi>Edward</hi> decea≈øed: and required that <hi>Harold</hi> ≈øhould be a Va≈ø≈øal to him. The Me≈ø≈øenger urged the ≈øame with ≈øo much confidence, that <hi>Harold</hi> in his fury could hardly forbear (though again≈øt the Law of Arms) to lay violent hands on the Amba≈ø≈øadour. And thereupon he returns a threatning Me≈ø≈øage to <hi>William</hi> to depart immediately back into <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> at his utmo≈øt peril. He then proceeds to mu≈øter his Forces, which were not ≈øo many as he expected, though divers Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others, who were inflamed with the love of the Rights and Liberties of their Native Country, joined with him to keep out this dangerous Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner.</p>
               <p>However King <hi>Harold</hi> with an undaunted courage led his men into <hi>Su≈ø≈øex,</hi> again≈øt the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt intreaty of his Mother, who endeavoured to hinder him, and pitching his Tents in a large fair Plain, not above ≈øeven miles from the Enemy, he ≈øent forth his Spies for di≈øcovery, who being taken by Duke <hi>William,</hi> he ordered that they ≈øhould view all his Tents, and then ≈øent them ≈øafely back to <hi>Harold.</hi> They commended <hi>Williams</hi> clemency, and his great ≈øtrength, but told <hi>Harold, that they thought all his Army were Prie≈øts, for their Beards were all ≈øhaved,</hi> whereas the u≈øe of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> was then to re≈øerve the hair of the upper lip without cutting.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Harold</hi> replied, <hi>they were no Prie≈øts, but men of great courage and valour, to his knowledge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> he having been formerly in that Country. <hi>Harold</hi> was thereupon per≈øuaded not to venture him≈øelf in the Battle, but to go on to levy more Souldiers.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56661:69"/>And his Brother told him that <hi>William</hi> charged him that he had taken an Oath to ≈øettle him in the Throne; and, ≈øaid he, <hi>Thou knowe≈øt what Oath thine own mouth hath made unto</hi> William, <hi>if it were lawful, and thou tooke≈øt it willingly, withdraw thy ≈øelf out of the Field, le≈øt for thy great ≈øin, the whole Army be de≈øtroyed, for there is no power that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt God.</hi> But <hi>Harold</hi> reproved his Brother for his freedom, and di≈ødainfully undervalued the ≈øtrength of the <hi>Normans,</hi> and ≈øeemed to conceive that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which he did being a private man, could now bind him when he was a Prince.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> being now come into the Field, and both Armies facing each other, as ready for Battle; to ≈øpare the effu≈øion of Chri≈øtian bloud, he ≈øent a Monk as a Mediator for Peace, offering <hi>Harold</hi> either to re≈øign the Kingdom to him≈øelf, and acknowledge him his Sovereign, or to trie the quarrel in ≈øingle Battle, in the ≈øight of both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: or la≈øtly, to ≈øtand to the Arbitrement of the Pope, who ≈øhould wear the Engli≈øh Crown.

               <p>Next day was the 14 of <hi>October,</hi> which upon a credulous Errour he always held to be fortunate to him, it being his Birth-day, and therefore he greatly de≈øired to engage in fight.

               <p>
                  <hi>Harold</hi> likewi≈øe with all expedition mar≈øhalled his Souldiers, placing the <hi>Kenti≈øh</hi> men in the Van (according to an ancient cu≈øtom) with their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Axes and Halberts, the <hi>Londoners</hi> and the <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle≈øex</hi> men were in that Squadron which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf and his Brother led.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Normans</hi> advancing forward, di≈øcharged a fierce Volley of Arrows like a Tempe≈øtuous Hail, which was a kind of Weapon the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> never under≈øtood, and therefore thought their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had been in the mid≈øt of them already. Soon after the Battle began in earne≈øt.

               <p>Yet did not the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> leave the Field, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved rather to maintain their honour in Arms, and ca≈øting them≈øelves into a Round, they prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red dying for their Country, rather than to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øake the Standard of their King, and thereupon encouraging one another, they made re≈øi≈øtance for a long time, but ≈øhowers of Arrows, like a mighty ≈øtorm, falling among them, one of them mo≈øt fatally, and unhappily for the Engli≈øh Nation,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56661:70"/>wounded King <hi>Harold</hi> into the Brains through the left Eye; ≈øo that falling from his Hor≈øe, he was ≈ølain under his own Standard, and an Ambu≈øh of Hor≈øemen cut many others to pieces.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>William</hi> fought ≈øo valiantly, that he had this day three Hor≈øes ≈ølain under him, and King <hi>Harold</hi> ≈øhewed no le≈øs courage, in killing many <hi>Normans</hi> with his own hands.

               <p>In the year 1235. the 19 of <hi>H.</hi> 3. ≈øeven <hi>Jews</hi> were brought before the King at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> who had ≈øtolen a Boy, and kept him private from the ≈øight of any, but their own Nation for a whole year, and had circumci≈øed him; intending al≈øo to have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him at the ≈øolemnity of <hi>Ea≈øter,</hi> as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves confe≈øt before the K. upon which they were convicted, and their bodies and goods remained at the Kings plea≈øure.

               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> 2. the number of the <hi>Jews</hi> throughout <hi>England</hi> was very great, yet wherefore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they dwelt, they were commanded not to bury their dead any where but in <hi>London,</hi> which being many times inconvenient to bring dead bodies from remote Places, the K. gave them liberty to bury in the ≈øame place where they lived.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56661:73"/>proceeded from words to blows, whereby many <hi>Jews</hi> were hurt, and ≈øome ≈ølain; and thereupon a report was ≈øuddenly ≈øpread abroad, that the King had commanded to have all the <hi>Jews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed; upon which it is incredible what rifling there was in an in≈øtant, of the <hi>Jews</hi> Hou≈øes, and cutting their throats, and though the King fignified by publick Declaration, that he was highly di≈øplea≈øed with what was done, yet there was no quieting of the multitude till next day; and many of the Mutineers were afterward puni≈øhed by the Law.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of King <hi>John</hi> 1202. Great ≈øums of money were exacted, and gathered from the <hi>Jews,</hi> among whom there was one who would not pay the money charged upon him till the King cau≈øed one of his great Teeth to be pulled out every day for ≈øeven days together, upon which he was at la≈øt compelled to give the King Ten Thou≈øand Marks of ≈øilver, that no more might, be pulled out ≈øince he had but one left in his head.</p>
               <p>K. <hi>Henry</hi> 3. being very profu≈øe, was brought ≈øo low for want of money that he was forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, nay almo≈øt beg it of his Subjects; but the <hi>Jews</hi> who were ever expo≈øed to his will, felt the weight of his nece≈ø≈øities; and one <hi>Abraham a Jew</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> being found a Delinquent, was con≈øtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem him≈øelf for 700 Marks.

               <p>In the 7. of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fir≈øt, the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi> crucified a Chri≈øtian Boy upon Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fryday, but did not throughly kill him; for which fact many <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> were, after Ea≈øter, drawn at the hor≈øe tails, and hanged; The ≈øame year King <hi>Edward</hi> called in all the old money, and coined new, becau≈øe it had been much clipped and defaced by the Jews, for which 297 were at one time executed in <hi>London.</hi> And in the eighteenth year of his Reign all the <hi>Jews</hi> were bani≈øhed out of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> there being at that time above fifteen thou≈øand in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who had all their Goods ≈øeized and confi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Kings u≈øe, and onely ≈øo much money left them as would bear their charges out of the kingdom.

               <p>In the Year 1656. ≈øeveral Propo≈øals were made to <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> by <hi>Mana≈ø≈øeh Ben I≈ørael</hi> a <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Merchant, in behalf of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation, for their free admi≈ø≈øion to trade, and exerci≈øe their Religion in <hi>England;</hi> and a Conference was held about it ≈øeveral days at <hi>Whitehall</hi> by divers Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Council, and certain Mini≈øters of the mo≈øt eminent then in e≈øteem, and many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were urged, ≈øome for, and others again≈øt their admi≈ø≈øion; but tho≈øe that were again≈øt it, ≈øo far prevailed, that the Propo≈øals took no effect.</p>
               <p>And ≈øo much concerning the <hi>Jews.</hi> To return now to the ≈øeries of the Story, King <hi>William
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56661:74"/>Rufus</hi> was taxed with great Prodigality, becau≈øe when his Chamberlain brought him a new pair of Ho≈øe, he asked what they co≈øt, and was told three ≈øhillings: <hi>Away ba≈øe Fellow,</hi> quoth he, <hi>are the≈øe be≈øeeming a King?

               <p>And though the Monks that writ in tho≈øe times, charge this King with covetou≈øne≈øs, yet by the following in≈øtance it doth not appear. For when two Monks came to Court, and offered large gifts to out-vie each other, in obtaining an Abbots place lately dead, a third Monk, who was very ≈øober, and mean in attire, came with them and ≈øtood by; whom the King asked, what he would give to be Abbot: <hi>Nothing</hi> (≈øaid the Monk) <hi>for I entered my Profe≈ø≈øion to be poor, and have hitherto little e≈øteemed the Pomp and Riches of the World. Then thou art the man</hi> (replied the King) <hi>and art more worthy to he their Abbot for thy Poverty, than they for their Pre≈øents;</hi> and conferring the place upon him, checked the others.</p>
               <p>But however there aro≈øe a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>An≈øelm</hi> Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> becau≈øe he required the Bi≈øhop to give him a Thou≈øand Marks for preferring him to that See, which <hi>An≈øelm</hi> refu≈øed to give, as judging it no le≈øs Simony to give after the preferment than before; but yet afterward offering five hundred pound, the King refu≈øed to accept it, as being worth (he ≈øaid) five times as much. Whereupon <hi>An≈øelm</hi> told
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56661:74"/>him, <hi>Your Grace may have me, and all that is mine, to ≈øerve your turn in a friendly manner; but in the way of ≈øervitude and bondage, you ≈øhall neither have me nor mine.</hi> Which-words ≈øo angred the King, that they could never after be reconciled. And <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelm</hi> often threatning to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> the King told him plainly, <hi>He would not thru≈øt him out of the Realm, but if he would go without his leave, he would keep him out during his plea≈øure: and be≈øides he ≈øhould carry nothing out of the Kingdom with him.</hi> Yet <hi>An≈øelm</hi> ventured it, and the King performed it; for <hi>William Walwer≈øt</hi> was ≈øent to rifle him of all he had in his pa≈ø≈øage to Sea; neither was he ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to return as long as the King lived: during all which time the King took the Profits of his Bi≈øhoprick to his own u≈øe.</p>
               <p>This King enlarged the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and compa≈ø≈øed it with new Walls; he al≈øo built the great Hall at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> being 270 foot in length, and 74 in breadth; but thinking it too little, he intended to have built another Hall, which ≈øhould have reached from the <hi>Thames</hi> to <hi>King≈øtreet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the fourth Year of his Reign, on St. <hi>Lukes</hi> day, ≈øo great a Tempe≈øt of Wind happened, that above ≈øix hundred Hou≈øes in <hi>London</hi> were thrown down therewith, and the Roof of S. <hi>Mary le Bow</hi> Church in Cheap≈øide was blown off, which with the Beams were carried into the Air a great height, and in the fall ≈øix of the Beams being 27 foot long, were driven ≈øo deep into the Ground (the ≈øtreets not being then paved with ≈øtone) that not above four foot remained in ≈øight, and yet ≈øtood in ≈øuch rank and order as the Workman had placed them on the Church.</p>
               <p>In the ninth Year of his Reign, a blazing Star ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with two Bu≈øhes or Tails, and other Stars ≈øeemed to ≈øhoot darts at each other. The la≈øt of his Reign, the Sea breaking over its Banks, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed

               <p>All which Prodigies ≈øeemed to foretel the Kings death approaching for having kept his Chri≈øtmas at <hi>Glouce≈øter,</hi> his <hi>Ea≈øter</hi> at <hi>Winche≈øter,</hi> and his <hi>Whit≈øuntide</hi> at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> notwith≈øtanding he was forewarned by many ≈øigns of ≈øome great di≈øa≈øter, as his own dream the night before, wherein it ≈øeemed to him that the Veins of his arms were bur≈øt, and abundance of blood ≈øtreaming on the floor. And of a certain Monk who dreamed that he ≈øaw the King gnaw the Image of a Crucifix with his Teeth, and that as he was about to bite away the Legs of it, the Crucifix with his feet ≈øpurn'd him down to the Ground, and that as he lay on the ground there came out of his Mouth a flame of fire with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ≈ømoke; this la≈øt being told the King, he made a je≈øt of it ≈øaying, <hi>Well a Monk he is, and he can dream only as Monks do, that is for gain, Go, give him an hundred ≈øhillings, le≈øt he think he hath dreamed unprofitably.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>My Friends, faithful Coun≈øellors, and Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, You know all undoubtedly, that my Brother</hi> Robert <hi>was elected and called by God him≈øelf to be the fortunate King of</hi> Jeru≈øalem, <hi>and how unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, or rather in≈øolently, he refu≈øed that ≈øacred E≈øtate, whereby he is now mo≈øt ju≈øtly reprobated of God. You al≈øo know by many other experiments, his Pride and Arrogancy, for being a man of a war like bumour, he is not onely impatient of Peace, but al≈øo earne≈øtly de≈øireth to trample upon you, as men of object and contemptible di≈øpo≈øitions, and upbraid you for idle Drones, Belly-gods, and what not? But I, your King, am naturally inclined to be both humble, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56661:77"/>peaceable, and take delight in nothing more than in doing, you good, and to maintain your Tranquillity, and ancient Liberty (as I have often ≈øworn unto you) and meekly and willingly to yield my ≈øelf to your advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereby I may circum≈øpectly govern you as a cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Prince. And to that end, even now will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm (if your Wi≈ødoms think fit) your over-worn and undermined Charters, and will corroborate them mo≈øt firmly with a new Oath and Ratification. In the mean time all the Laws which the holy King</hi> Edward, <hi>by Gods in≈øpiring did e≈øtabli≈øh, I do here command to be inviolably ob≈øerved, hereby to move you to adhere ≈øtedfa≈øtly unto me, in chearfully, willingly, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repul≈øing the wrongs offered me; by my Brother ≈øhall I ≈øay? Nay, by the mo≈øt deadly Enemy both to me, to you, and the whole Nation. For if I be guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the Valour and Affections of</hi> Engli≈øhmen, I <hi>≈øhall ≈øcorn the threats of him and his</hi> Normans, <hi>and count them vain, and not to be regarded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With the≈øe fair promi≈øes (which yet he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward quite neglected) he ≈øo won the hearts of the Lords and the <hi>Londoners,</hi> that they engaged to die with him, or for him, again≈øt any oppo≈øition what≈øoever. Duke <hi>Robert</hi> being gone, and <hi>Henry</hi> thus ≈øetled in the affection of the People, he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed a very great Army, and, accompanied with divers of the Nobility, ≈øailed to <hi>Normandy,</hi> where falling upon <hi>Robert</hi> before he was half ready to fight, he obtained a compleat Victory over him, and won <hi>Normandy</hi> with the ≈ølaughter of ten thou≈øand men, taking <hi>Robert</hi> him≈øelf pri≈øoner; whom he brought over and committed to <hi>Cardiff</hi> Ca≈øtle in <hi>Wales,</hi> where he remained a pri≈øoner till he died: yet had liberty of walking in the Kings Meadows and Pa≈øtures. But being weary of this Confinement, he endeavoured to make his e≈øcape, which the King being afraid of, ordered his eyes to be put out, which to avoid the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

               <p>This, though it increa≈øed his mi≈øery, yet did not ≈øhorten his life, for he lived long after; in all, from the time of his Impri≈øonment, twenty eight years.

               <p>This King <hi>Henry</hi> fir≈øt in≈øtituted the Form of the High Court of Parliament: for before his time, onely certain of the Nobility and Prelates of the Realm were called to con≈øultation about the mo≈øt important Affairs of State, but he cau≈øed the Commons al≈øo to be a≈ø≈øembled, by Knights, Citizens, and Burge≈ø≈øes of their own electing, and made that Court to con≈øi≈øt of three E≈øtates, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the Clergy, and the Commons, repre≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Body of the Realm, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

The fir≈øt Parliament that was ≈øo held, met at <hi>Salisbury</hi> upon the 19 of <hi>April</hi> in the 16 Year of his Reign, 1019. He forbid wearing of long hair, which at that time was frequent, according to the <hi>French</hi> Mode. He commanded Robers on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to be hanged without Redemption. He puni≈øhed Counterfeiters of Money with pulling out their eyes, or cutting off their privy members; a puni≈øhment both le≈øs than Death, and greater.</p>

               <p>This King left behind him onely one daughter named <hi>Maud,</hi> who could never come to be Queen, though born to a Kingdom. She was married at ≈øix years old to the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and after his death, ≈øhe was again married to <hi>Fulk</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> Yet her Father took much care to e≈øtabli≈øh the Succe≈ø≈øion in her and her i≈ø≈øue, and therefore he called his Nobility together, and among them <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and made them take their Oaths of Allegiance to her, and her Heirs. This he did three years one after another, wherein nothing plea≈øed him ≈øo much, as that <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Blois</hi> was the fir≈øt man that took the Oath, becau≈øe he was known to be, or it was known at lea≈øt, that he might be a pretender to the Crown. But the King ≈øhould have con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no Oath is binding when the getting a Kingdom is the price of breaking it, and e≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Stephen</hi> who was ≈øo deeply intere≈øted. Yet Providence could do no more, and the King was well ≈øatisfied with it, e≈øpecially when he ≈øaw his daughter Mother of two Sons; for this, though it gave him no a≈ø≈øurance, yet it gave him a≈ø≈øured hope to have the Crown perpetuated in his Po≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>Yet after King <hi>Henry</hi> was dead, <hi>Stephen</hi> a≈øcends the Throne, as being Earl of <hi>Bulleign,</hi> Son to <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Beis,</hi> by <hi>Adela</hi> daughter of King

Yet <hi>Stephen</hi> was no ≈øooner ≈øet in his Chair of State, but <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> enters <hi>England</hi> with an Army to defend the right of <hi>Maud,</hi> but he was ≈øoon compounded with, and ≈øo was <hi>Geoffrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou, Mauds</hi> husband.</p>
               <p>Soon after <hi>Maud</hi> her ≈øelf comes into <hi>England,</hi> and was received by ≈øome Per≈øons for Queen; and <hi>Stephen</hi> hearing that ≈øome of her Forces had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieged <hi>Lincoln,</hi> goes thither, where his Army was overthrown, and him≈øelf taken Pri≈øoner, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Maud,</hi> who committed him to <hi>Bri≈øtol</hi> Ca≈øtle. And being flu≈øht with this ≈øucce≈øs, ≈øhe takes her journey toward <hi>London,</hi> and was there received joyfully, as well as in other places, where <hi>Matilda</hi> wife of King <hi>Stephen</hi> made humble ≈øuit to her for the Liberty of her Husband, and that he might be ≈øuffered onely to live a private life. The <hi>Londoners</hi> likewi≈øe having received her into the City as their Queen, thought now (as Subjects u≈øually do with new Princes) they might have what they would rea≈øonably ask; and therefore humbly be≈øought her, that the ≈øevere Laws impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed upon them by her Father, might be remitted, and tho≈øe of King <hi>Edward</hi> might wholly be in force. But ≈øhe rejected both the≈øe Petitions, ≈øome ≈øay out of Pride, others out of mi≈øtaken Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, as thinking it mo≈øt ≈øafe to act matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, not upon intreaty but freely, and to

               <p>But tho≈øe har≈øh and in≈øulting An≈øwers ≈øhe gave them, were at that time very un≈øea≈øonable, and though they might have been more proper in a ≈øetled Government, yet in this her green and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtable e≈øtate, they gave a ≈øtop to the Current of all her Fortunes. For <hi>Matilda</hi> finding by this how high the Empre≈ø≈øes pul≈øes beat, ≈øent to her ≈øon <hi>Eu≈øtace</hi> to rai≈øe Forces in <hi>Kent,</hi> ≈øince their ≈øuits mu≈øt be onely obtained by the Sword.

Of which <hi>Maud</hi> having notice, fled ≈øecretly out of <hi>London</hi> and went to <hi>Oxford;</hi> and from thence ≈øent ≈øtrict command that King <hi>Stephen</hi> ≈øhould be laid in Irons, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly watched, and fed with very mean Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and ≈øending to <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> for a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, they laid fiege to <hi>Winche≈øter.</hi>

                  <hi>Matilda,</hi> King <hi>Stephens</hi> wife, hearing of this, ≈øhe with her Son <hi>Eu≈øtace,</hi> and the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the <hi>Londoners</hi> came pre≈øently to the relief of the place, where a fierce Battle was fought, and <hi>Matilda's</hi> Party prevailed, and the Empre≈øs <hi>Maud</hi> to make her e≈øcape, was fain to be laid upon a Hor≈øe back like a dead Corps, and ≈øo conveyed to <hi>Gloce≈øter.</hi> But Earl <hi>Robert</hi> her Brother, di≈ødaining to flie, was taken Pri≈øoner, and u≈øed more hardly by Queen <hi>Matilda</hi> for her Husband King <hi>Stephens</hi> ≈øake; but a while after, whether by agreement, or connivance, both <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> al≈øo made their e≈øcape out of Pri≈øon.</p>

But being a Woman (who≈øe Sex hath often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived wi≈øe men) ≈øhe re≈øolved once more to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach her Enemy by Craft, ≈øince ≈øhe could not do it by Force. For it being a very cold Winter, the River <hi>Thames</hi> that runs by the Walls of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was very hard frozen, and at the ≈øame time a deep Snow covered the ground; <hi>Maud</hi> takes the advantage thereof, and clothing her ≈øelf and four of her company in white linen garments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the eyes of the Centinel, ≈øhe goes ≈øecretly in the night out of a Po≈øtern Gate, and pa≈ø≈øing the frozen River, ran on foot through Ice and Snow, Ditches, and Vallies for five miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till ≈øhe came to <hi>Abington,</hi> the falling Snow beating in their faces all the way, and there taking Hor≈øe, the ≈øame night got into <hi>Wallingford</hi> Ca≈øtle. But though <hi>Maud</hi> e≈øcaped this pre≈øent danger, vet it left ≈øuch an Impre≈ø≈øion of fear upon her, that ≈øhe never after had a mind to appear upon the Stage of War, but left the pro≈øecution of it to her ≈øon <hi>Henry,</hi> who was now about ≈øixteen years of Age.</p>
               <p>And not long after, <hi>Eu≈øtace,</hi> King <hi>Stephens</hi> only ≈øon died, and being left de≈øtitute of I≈ø≈øue to ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, he was the more ea≈øily drawn to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace: and ≈øo it was at la≈øt concluded that <hi>Stephen</hi> ≈øhould hold the kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and adopt <hi>Henry</hi> as his Heir to ≈øucceed him. This Agreement thus made and confirmed by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Henry</hi> accounted King <hi>Stephen</hi> ever after as his Father, and <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> as his ≈øon; and well he might if it be true which ≈øome write, that <hi>Maud</hi> his Mother, when a Battle was to be fought between King <hi>Stephen</hi> and her ≈øon, went privately

               <p>In the ≈øixteenth year of his Reign, King <hi>Henry</hi> cau≈øed his elde≈øt ≈øon <hi>Henry</hi> to be crowned at <hi>We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min≈øter,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Roger</hi> Archbi≈øhop of <hi>York,</hi> and cau≈øed all the Lords to ≈øwear Allegiance to him, as having found by Experience, <hi>That Oaths for Succe≈ø≈øion are commonly eluded, but Oaths for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Allegiance can have no eva≈øion.</hi> At the Fea≈øt of this Solemnity, King <hi>Henry,</hi> to honour his ≈øon, would needs carry up the fir≈øt di≈øh to his Table. Whereupon Archbi≈øhop <hi>Roger</hi> ≈øtanding by, and ≈øaying merrily to the new King, <hi>What an honour is this to you, to have ≈øuch a Waiter at your Table:</hi> He briskly replied, <hi>Why what a matter is it for him that was but the ≈øon of a Duke to do ≈øervice to me that am the ≈øon of a King and a Queen.</hi> Which the old King hearing, began to repent of what he had done; yet he pa≈ø≈øed it over, and ≈øet the be≈øt ≈øide outward.</p>
               <p>This young King died before his Father, ≈øo that <hi>Richard</hi> the Fir≈øt, the elde≈øt ≈øon then living, ≈øucceeded his Father in the Throne, and was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56661:82"/>crowned at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> 1189. He drained great ≈øums of money from the <hi>Londoners,</hi> and made them recompence in Franchi≈øes and Liberties. And indeed the Laws and Ordinances in his time were chiefly made for the Meridian of <hi>London.</hi> For whereas before his time the City was gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Portgraves,</hi> this King granted them to be governed by two Sheriffs and a Mayor, as it is now. And to give the fir≈øt of the≈øe Magi≈øtrates the honour to be remembred, the names of the Sherifts were <hi>Henry Cornhill,</hi> and <hi>Richard Reyner,</hi> and the name of the fir≈øt Lord Mayor was <hi>Henry Fitz-Alwin,</hi> who continued Mayor during his life, which was four and twenty Years. But <hi>Fabian</hi> who was him≈øelf Sheriff of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore mo≈øt likely to know the truth, affirmeth, That the Officers ordained now by K. <hi>Rich.</hi> were but only 2 Bailiffs, and that there was no Mayor nor Sheriffs till the tenth of King <hi>John.</hi> But however the City now began fir≈øt to receive the Form and State of a Common-wealth (≈øaith the Hi≈øtorian) and to be divided into Fellow≈øhips and Corporations, as at this day: and this Priviledge was granted the fir≈øt of <hi>Richard</hi> 1. 1189.</p>
               <p>This King left no Children behind him, that we have any certain account of, unle≈øs we reckon as a <hi>Popi≈øh</hi> Prie≈øt did, who coming to King <hi>Richard</hi> told him, that he had three very wicked Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which he de≈øired him to be≈øtow, or el≈øe Gods wrath would attend him. But the King denying he had any Daughters at all, <hi>Yes</hi> (≈øaith the Prie≈øt) <hi>thou cheri≈øhe≈øt three Daughters, Pride, Covetou≈øne≈øs, and Lechery.</hi> The King apprehended his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ≈ømiling thereat, called his Lords attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ≈øaid, <hi>My Lords, this Hypocritical Prie≈øt hath de≈øcovered, that I maintain three Daughters, Pride, Covetou≈øne≈øs, and Lechery, which he would have me be≈øtow in Marriage; and therefore if I have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56661:82"/>any ≈øuch, I have found out very fit Husband for them all. My Pride I bequeath to the haughty Templers and Ho≈øpitallers, who are as proud as</hi> Lucifer <hi>him≈øelf: my Covetou≈øne≈øs I give to the White Monks of the</hi> Ci≈øtercian <hi>Order, for they covet the Devil and all: but for my Lechery, I can be≈øtow it no where better than on the Prie≈øts, and Bi≈øhops of our times, for therein they place their greate≈øt felicity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs.</hi>

               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> being dead, the Right of Succe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion remained in <hi>Arthur</hi> ≈øon of <hi>Jeffery</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> elder brother to E. <hi>John;</hi> but <hi>John</hi> thinking <hi>Arthurs</hi> Title but a Critici≈øm of State, and not ≈øo plain to common capacities as his own, who was Son of a King and Brother to a King, a≈øcended the Throne as confidently as if he had no Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor, onely <hi>Hubert</hi> Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> made an Oration on his behalf, wherein waving the <hi>Right of Succe≈ø≈øion,</hi> he in≈øi≈øted wholly upon the <hi>Right of Election</hi> by the People, whereby it would follow, that tho≈øe who brought him in, might throw him out. Of which the Bi≈øhop being told, ≈øaid, <hi>He did it on purpo≈øe to cau≈øe King</hi> John <hi>to be more careful of his Government, by making him ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible upon what an uncertain foundation his Regality ≈øtood.</hi> King <hi>John</hi> took notice of this, but ≈øince it would ≈øerve his pre≈øent purpo≈øe, he let it pa≈øs, knowing that his turn once ≈øerved, he could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward carve out what Title he plea≈øed, and ≈øo upon A≈øcen≈øion day 1199. he was crowned King at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter.</hi>

The Death of whom, and al≈øo of <hi>Geoffry Fitz-Peter,</hi> who while the King lived, kept him in ≈øome awe, left the King at full liberty to his own wild de≈øires. For at the fir≈øt hearing of <hi>Geoffries</hi> death, he ≈øwore, <hi>By the Feet of God,</hi> that now at length he was King of <hi>England:</hi> and with great rejoicing ≈øaid to ≈øome Lords about him, <hi>Now when this man comes into Hell, let him ≈øalute the Archbi≈øhop</hi> Hubert, <hi>whom certainly he ≈øhall find there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this the Lords of the Realm having often required their Ancient Rights and Liberties, and finding nothing but delu≈øions, they would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger endure to be abu≈øed: but meeting together, they con≈øider of ≈øome remedy, and conclude to go to the King them≈øelves in per≈øon, and make their demands, producing likewi≈øe a Charter, which had been granted in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fir≈øt's time.

               <p>But the King never intending to do as he ≈øaid, falls pre≈øently to rai≈øe Souldiers; which the Lords under≈øtanding, they all did the like: and going to the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> they deliver

               </p>
               <p>The King being highly offended, asked, <hi>Why they did not al≈øo require his Kingdom, the≈øe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands being grounded on no colour of Rea≈øon;</hi> and then ≈øwore a great Oath, <hi>That be would die before he would en≈ølave him≈øelf to them by ≈øuch Conce≈ø≈øions.</hi> The Lords by this an≈øwer knowing what they mu≈øt tru≈øt to, appointed <hi>Robert Fitzwater</hi> to be their General, whom they ≈øtiled, <hi>The Mar≈øhal of Gods Army, and Holy Church.</hi> Then they be≈øieged <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Bedford,</hi> and the Governour of the la≈øt being a Confederate, delivered it up to them. But the <hi>Londoners</hi> di≈øplea≈øed with the King for burthening them with Taxes, not onely admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, but invited them to enter the City by night.</p>
               <p>The Lords having now this key of the Land at their di≈øpo≈øe, ≈øent ≈øuch threatning Letters and Me≈ø≈øages abroad, that they drew mo≈øt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility from the King, who being at <hi>Wind≈øor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding an Army; And having notice thereof, and that the <hi>Londoners</hi> were joined with them, he thought good to proceed rather by Fraud than Force; and thereupon ≈øends to the Lords, <hi>That if they would come to him to</hi> Wind≈øor, <hi>he would grant their demands.</hi> The Lords coming thither, but in a Military manner, for they dur≈øt not tru≈øt his word; the King ≈øaluted them all kindly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to give them ≈øatisfaction in all they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And ≈øo in a Meadow between <hi>Wind≈øor</hi> and <hi>Stanes,</hi> called <hi>Running Mead,</hi> and afterward <hi>Council Mead,</hi> he freely con≈øented to confirm their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Liberties contained in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and

               <p>But the next day, when it ≈øhould be done the King goes privately the night before to <hi>Southam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton.,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>I≈øle of Wight</hi> where advi≈øing with his Council, It was concluded he ≈øhould ≈øend to the Pope to acquaint him with this Mutiny of the Lords, and require his help, while the King in the mean time lived ≈økulking up and down in corners that no man might know where to find him, or which is wor≈øe (as ≈øome write) roving about and Practi≈øing pyracy. And now the Lords begin to ≈øu≈øpect fraud, when ≈øhortly after the Kings Me≈ø≈øengers who were <hi>Walter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Bi≈øhops of <hi>Worce≈øter</hi> and <hi>Norwich,</hi> return with the Popes Decree, whereby the Barons Charter was by definitive Sentence cancelled and made void, and the King and Barons accur≈øed, if either of them ob≈øerved the Compo≈øition.

In this Kings time likewi≈øe, five and thirty of the mo≈øt ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantial Citizens were cho≈øen out, and called the <hi>Common Council</hi> of the City.</p>
               <p>In this Kings time there fell Hail as big as Goo≈øe eggs, with great Thunder and Lightning, ≈øo that many Men, Women, and Cattle were de≈øtroyed, Hou≈øes overthrown and burned, and Corn in the Fields beaten down. In 1202. and the 4. of King <hi>John,</hi> there began a Fro≈øt the 14. of <hi>January,</hi> which continued to the 22. of <hi>March,</hi> that the Ground could not be tilled, ≈øo that in the Summer following a Quarter of Wheat was ≈øold for a Mark, which in the days of <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øecond was ≈øold for twelve pence, and a Quarter of Beans or Oats for a Groat; and why the di≈øproportion in the prices is now ≈øo great, (≈øince the price of Silver is much le≈øs altered, for an ounce of Silver was then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at twenty pence, which is now valued at five ≈øhillings) mu≈øt be left to Philo≈øophers to give the rea≈øon: for ≈øince ≈øcarcity makes things dear, why ≈øhould not plenty make them cheap?</p>
               <p>About this time Fi≈øhes of ≈øtrange ≈øhape were taken, armed with Helmets and Shields, like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men, onely they were much bigger. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56661:89"/>Mon≈øter was likewi≈øe found, ≈øtricken with Lightning not far from <hi>London,</hi> which had an head like an A≈øs, a belly like a Man, and all other parts far differing from any other Creature. And in another place, a Fi≈øh was taken alive in the form of a Man, and was kept ≈øix Months upon Land with raw fle≈øh and fi≈øh, and then becau≈øe they could not make it ≈øpeak, they ca≈øt it into the Sea again.</p>
               <p>In the ninth of King <hi>John</hi> the Arches and Stone bridge over the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>London</hi> was quite fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed by <hi>Serle Mercer,</hi> and <hi>William Alman</hi> then Procurators, and Ma≈øters of the Bridge-hou≈øe: and ≈øoon after a great Fire happened there, of which you have already an account.</p>
               <p>After the death of King <hi>John,</hi> his elde≈øt Son <hi>Henry,</hi> being not above ten years old, ≈øucceeded him, and was therefore very unfit to govern in ≈øuch a di≈øtracted time, when a great part of the kingdom had ≈øworn Allegiance to Prince <hi>Lewis.</hi> However upon <hi>October</hi> 8. 1216. he was crowned at <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, where be≈øides the u≈øual Oath taken by all Kings, he did Homage al≈øo to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> for the kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and promi≈øed the true payment of the Thou≈øand Marks a year, which his Father had granted to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then <hi>William Mar≈øhal</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was by general con≈øent made Protector of the Realm, during the Kings Minority.

                  <hi>Lewis,</hi> whom they them≈øelves had invited to come, and yet it ≈øeemed extream di≈øloyalty to ≈øtand in oppo≈øition to <hi>Henry</hi> their innocent natural Soveraign; but the di≈øcovery of Vi≈øcount <hi>Melun,</hi> that <hi>Lewis</hi> intended to extirpate all the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and the cur≈øe of <hi>Wallo</hi> the Popes Legate again≈øt all who ≈øhould join with <hi>Lewis,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other rea≈øons, cau≈øed the principal of them to ≈øhrink from <hi>Lewis</hi> and join with King <hi>Henry,</hi> as thinking no obligation ≈øo great as Allegiance; many others ≈øtaid with <hi>Lewis,</hi> as thinking none greater than an Oath.</p>
               <p>And now Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> fearing that his enemies having gotten an head, ≈øhould likewi≈øe gather a head, and draw more Forces together, ≈øtaying him≈øelf in <hi>London,</hi> ≈øent his Lieutenant with an Army of Twenty thou≈øand to take in what Towns he could get, ≈øome of which they took with ≈ømall re≈øi≈øtance; but <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> the Protector, coming again≈øt them with an Army, utterly routed <hi>Lewis,</hi> and took mo≈øt of the Lords that adhered to him Pri≈øoners; and though his Father <hi>Philip</hi> ≈øent him more Forces, yet they were defeated at Sea, ≈øo that <hi>Lewis</hi> upon payment of ≈øome monies, and other conditions, returned into <hi>France,</hi> and King <hi>Henry</hi> took an Oath, and for him, the Popes Legate <hi>Wallo,</hi> and the Protector, <hi>That he would re≈øtore to the Barons of the Realm, and other his Subjects, all their Rights and Priviledges for which the di≈øcord began between the late King and his People.</hi> And afterward he confirmed the two Charters of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>Charta Fore≈øtae,</hi> granted by his Father King <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Tenth year of King <hi>Henries</hi> Reign, and the nineteenth of his Age, he claimed to take the Government upon him≈øelf, and no longer to be under a Protector, after which there pre≈øently appeared the difference between a Prince that is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56661:90"/>ruled by good coun≈øel, and one that will do all of his own will, and take no Advice. For thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years he was ruled by a Protector, and then all pa≈ø≈øed as it were in a calm without noi≈øe, or clamour; but as ≈øoon as he took upon him the Government, ≈øtorms and tumults pre≈øently aro≈øe, neither was there any quietne≈øs with the Subject, nor him≈øelf, nothing but Grievances all the long time of his Reign.</p>
               <p>For as ≈øoon as he was crowned again, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently cancels and annuls the <hi>Charter of the Fore≈øts,</hi> as granted in his Nonage, and therefore not bound to ob≈øerve it, and then makes a new Seal, forcing all that had Grants by the former, to renew them, whereby he got abundance of money. After which he goes over into <hi>France</hi> to recover his Rights there: to which purpo≈øe he rai≈øes great ≈øums of money from the <hi>Londoners</hi> for Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of their Liberties. About which time <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantine Fitz-Arnulf</hi> a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> (upon a tumult which aro≈øe in the City at a Wre≈øtling, which he purpo≈øely appointed) endeavoured to ≈øet up <hi>Lewis</hi> again, and in the heat of the di≈øtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance he traiterou≈øly cried out <hi>Mountjoy, Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, God for us and our Lord</hi> Lewis.</p>
               <p>And though the Lord Mayor, who was a very di≈øcreet per≈øon, earne≈øtly per≈øuaded them to be quiet, yet <hi>Con≈øtantine</hi> by his ≈øeditious Orations, had made the people incapable of good coun≈øel; ≈øo that there was little hope of appea≈øing them. The Lord Chief Ju≈øtice having notice hereof, pre≈øently rai≈øed Forces and entered the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and ≈øent for the principal men of the City to come before him, who all di≈øclaimed their being concerned therein, and charged <hi>Fitz Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulph</hi> to be the chief Author thereof. But he re≈øolutely an≈øwered, <hi>That he had not done ≈øo much therein as he ought.</hi> Whereupon he was condemned
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56661:91"/>to die, together with the Crier who publi≈øhed the Proclamation, and his Nephew; and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly executed, though when he ≈øaw the Halter about his neck, he offered Fifteen thou≈øand Marks for the ≈øaving of his life. This Execution being done without noi≈øe, or the knowledge of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> the Lord Chief Ju≈øtice comes into the City, and apprehending ≈øeveral who where guilty of this Tumult, he cau≈øeth their hands and feet to be cut off, for a terrour to the re≈øt, and then ≈øet them at liberty. The King likewi≈øe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed ≈øeveral of the Magi≈øtrates, but afterwards finding that the ba≈øer ≈øort of People onely were concerned in the Di≈øorder, he thereupon was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the City.</p>
               <p>About this time an Execrable Impo≈øtor was brought before the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who ob≈øerving how ea≈øily the People were delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in tho≈øe times of Darkne≈øs and Super≈øtition, he impudently cau≈øed him≈øelf to be wounded in his hands, feet, and ≈øides, that by the re≈øemblance of the≈øe bloudy Impre≈ø≈øions, he might be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for their very Saviour: who was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon de≈øervedly immured up between four Walls; and with him a wretched Woman, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of this Chri≈øt; and ≈øome ≈øay another who called her ≈øelf <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> this puni≈øhment being thought fitte≈øt for ≈øuch Mi≈øcreants, as Mon≈øters too impious, and unworthy to die by Humane hands; though it is very remarkable, that this man ≈øhould have ≈øuch a ≈øevere judgment at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and yet St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who was guilty of the ≈øame Impo≈øture, as to the wounds of Chri≈øt, though not the name, ≈øhould ≈øoon after be canonized at <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>chief of Saints;</hi> and perhaps if this Mon≈øter had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> he had been likewi≈øe Sainted; and if Saint <hi>Francis</hi> had been at <hi>Oxford</hi> he had been immured.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56661:91"/>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> returning from <hi>France,</hi> brought over many <hi>French</hi> men with him, which he puts in places of Tru≈øt and Profit, and removes and fines his old Officers. The Lords could no longer endure ≈øo many indignities, to ≈øee them≈øelves ≈ølighted and Strangers advanced, their Per≈øons likewi≈øe expo≈øed to danger, and their E≈øtates to ruine, for which they could find no remedy but the Kings confirming their <hi>Charter of Liberties,</hi> wherein it is ≈øtrange to ≈øee upon what different grounds the King and the Lords went. It ≈øeems the King thought, that to confirm their Charter, was to make him≈øelf le≈øs than a King; and the Lords thought, as long as that was denied, they were no better than Slaves; and as the King could endure no Diminution, ≈øo the Lords could endure no Slavery. But the King might keep his own with ≈øitting ≈øtill; the Lords could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their own but by motion.</p>
               <p>And hereupon they confederated together, the chief among them being <hi>Richard</hi> the Brother of <hi>William</hi> late Protector, and now Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhal, who repair to the King and boldly tell him of his faults, and require ≈øatisfaction. Whereupon the King pre≈øently ≈øends for whole Legions of <hi>French</hi> men over, and withal ≈øummons a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whither the Lords refu≈øe to come.

The King being ≈øtung with this ju≈øt Reprehen≈øion, began by their advice, to call his Sheriffs Bailiffs, and other Officers to a ≈øtrict account, and ≈øqueezed great ≈øums of money out of them, forcing <hi>Ralph Briton</hi> his Lord Trea≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,

               <p>In the 21 Year of this Kings Reign another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is called at <hi>London,</hi> where the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a great ≈øum of money, which being directly oppo≈øed, the King promi≈øeth by Oath never more to injure the Nobility, ≈øo they would but relieve him at pre≈øent, and that he would u≈øe onely the Coun≈øel of his Natural Subjects, and freely grant the inviolable ob≈øervation of their Liberties.

               <p>The King was ≈øo moved at this their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrance, that taking his Oath to refer the matter to divers grave men of the kingdom, Articles were drawn, ≈øealed, and publickly ≈øet up to the view of all.

This Expedition had no better ≈øucce≈øs than the former; for after a whole years ≈øtay, the King was forced to make a di≈øhonourable Truce with the <hi>French,</hi> and upon his return home, he laid new Exactions on the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Londoners.</hi>

               <p>The King had now abundance of Grandees come to ≈øee him from Foreign parts, and having called a Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> he is ≈øharply taxed for his Expences, and ≈øeverely reprehended for his breach of promi≈øe; having vowed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his Charter, never more to injure the State again; al≈øo for his violent taking up Provi≈øions of Wax, Silk, Robes, and e≈øpecially of Wine, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will of the Seller, and many other Grievances they complain of.

But Sir <hi>John Man≈øel,</hi> one of his Council ≈øpake thus to ≈øome who was ready to execute his will:</p>

                  <hi>Gentlemen and Friends, It is not nece≈ø≈øary for us to put that pre≈øently in execution which the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth in his anger; for it may be when his wrath is over, he will be ≈øorry for what he hath ≈øaid.

               <p>About this time the King by Proclamation calls the <hi>Londoners</hi> to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> and there cau≈øeth the Bi≈øhops of <hi>Worce≈øter</hi> &amp; <hi>Chiche≈øter</hi> to declare his intentions, and to exhort the People to undertake

               <p>But the <hi>Londoners</hi> had no mind to this Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and therefore all the Bi≈øhops Arguments prevailed onely upon three poor Knights, whom the King thereupon in open view, embraceth, ki≈ø≈øeth, and calls his Brethren; but checks the <hi>Londoners</hi> as ignoble Mercenaries, and there him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf takes his Oath for performing this Journey, and to ≈øet forth upon <hi>Mid≈øummer</hi> day next.

               <p>Now for money to carry on this, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands a Tenth of the E≈øtates of the Clergy and Laiety for three years together.

               <p>After this the Lords ≈øent a Letter to the King, and prote≈øted with all humility and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion that they intended nothing but the performance of their Oaths, by defending tho≈øe Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances which had been e≈øtabli≈øhed in Parliament for the benefit of the King and the Realm. But the King, his Brother <hi>Richard,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> the young Prince, thinking nothing more di≈ødainful than that Subjects ≈øhould rule and command their Sovereign, re≈øolved to revenge it, and bid utter defiance to the Lords; and both Armies met near a Town called <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Su≈ø≈øex,</hi> where a cruel Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel was fought, and the King, his Brother, and the Prince, were all taken pri≈øoners, with many other great Commanders, and twenty thou≈øand men ≈ølain. Yet a while after, upon ≈øome Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56661:99"/>they were all three ≈øet at Liberty, and the former Laws and Ordinances were confirmed in Parliament, and the King took an Oath for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the power of the twelve Peers.</p>
               <p>After which the Earls of <hi>Leice≈øter</hi> and <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> the two Generals of the Lords Party, fell into a great difference; which Prince <hi>Edward</hi> taking advantage of, rai≈øeth an Army, and per≈øuading the Earl of <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> to join with him, they fell upon the Earl of <hi>Leice≈øters</hi> Army, and utterly routed them, him≈øelf, his elde≈øt Son, and many others being ≈ølain. Which overthrow utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the Barons, and revived the Melancholy King: who calling a Parliament, all the former Decrees were made void, together with the power of the twelve Peers, and the King regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his former Liberty and Authority.</p>
               <p>When this Parliament was ended, the King (perhaps by the in≈øtigation of his Brother <hi>Richard,</hi> who was ≈øo horridly abu≈øed without cau≈øe, by the ba≈øer ≈øort of the Inhabitants of the City) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved utterly to de≈øtroy and con≈øume the City of <hi>London</hi> by Fire, becau≈øe he ≈øaid the Magi≈øtrates and Inhabitants had always hated him, and taken part with the Lords again≈øt him. Whereupon tho≈øe of the Nobility, who were mo≈øt in favour with the King, humbly be≈øought him, <hi>By no means to do ≈øuch an execrable deed, which would not onely weaken his own Kingdom and Government, but would likewi≈øe make him infamous throughout the World to all Generations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They were very earne≈øt in their ≈øuit, and their Rea≈øons were unan≈øwerable: yet the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øted, <hi>That he was re≈øolved to do it, and his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ≈øhould be unchangeable, and his Ju≈øtice upon ≈øuch Rebellious Villains, ≈øhould be a Pre≈øident to deter all perver≈øe and ob≈øtinate Rebels and Traitors in time to come.</hi> This ≈øevere Re≈øolution made the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56661:100"/>tremble, at the indignation of their angry King; ≈øo that perceiving his rage and fury not to be mitigated, they cau≈øed an in≈øtrument to be drawn in writing, which was confirmed with their Common Seal, wherein they confe≈ø≈øed their Rebellion, and humbly craved pardon for the ≈øame; and without any exception or re≈øervation, they wholly ≈øubmitted their Lands, Goods, and Lives, together with the whole City, to the Kings Grace and Mercy.</p>
               <p>This In≈øtrument they ≈øent to <hi>Wind≈øor</hi> to the King, by ≈øome of the chiefe≈øt of the Citizens, who were ordered to pre≈øent it on their knees; but ≈øo furious was the Kings wrath again≈øt them, and ≈øo implacable was his anger, that he reputed none to be his Friends, who interpo≈øed as Mediators on their behalf: neither would he admit any of them into his pre≈øence, but commanded them immediately to be thrown into pri≈øon, and five of the principal of them he gave to the Prince, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all their Lands and Goods; and all the re≈øt he be≈øtowed among his Attendants, who made them Slaves, and ≈øuffered them to enjoy the lea≈øt part of their own.</p>
               <p>But when the King had thus a little revenged him≈øelf, and time had cooled his mighty pa≈ø≈øion, he began to hearken to the importunate interce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son, and ≈øoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the City and all its Inhabitants into favour again, and laying onely a Fine upon them of a thou≈øand Marks, he re≈øtored to them all their Charters, Liberties, and Cu≈øtoms, which for their tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions he had ≈øeized into his hands.</p>
               <p>And now though the≈øe Inte≈øtine Troubles and Civil Wars, which like an outragious Fire di≈øper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed into the mid≈øt of a well compacted City, had end angered the whole State of the kingdom, were thus appea≈øed; and though the Earl of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øter</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56661:100"/>by his revolt from the Barons, and joining with the Prince, had greatly furthered this good work, and had cau≈øed the King to enjoy a happy peace; yet was this Earl ≈øo little tru≈øted, that he found neither favour nor reward; but was much ≈ølighted, and had but cold entertainment at Court, which he highly re≈øented, and meditated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
               <p>In this fury he came headlong into the City of <hi>London,</hi> and complaining of his ill u≈øage, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people flockt in Troops about him, and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly committed many notorious outrages with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City, forgetting the great Calamity they had lately ≈øuffered, and what favours they had received. From thence they went to the Kings Palace at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> which they mo≈øt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barou≈øly rifled, ≈øpoiled, and ran≈øacked. This might have produced another Civil War, but the Tumult was in a little time di≈øper≈øed, and the Prince again interpo≈øed him≈øelf an earne≈øt Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between the King and all the Offenders, and procured a large and free pardon for the Earl of <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> whereby all things were again appea≈øed and quieted.</p>
               <p>After which the Earl of <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> and Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> went into the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till after the death of his Father.</p>
               <p>It is ob≈øerved of this King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, that he was never con≈øtant in his love nor his hate; for he never had ≈øo great a Favourite but he ca≈øt him off with di≈øgrace, nor ≈øo great an Enemy whom he received not into favour. An example of both which Qualities was ≈øeen in his carriage to <hi>Hubert de Burgh,</hi> who was for a time the greate≈øt Favourite, yet ca≈øt out afterward in mi≈øerable di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; and then no man held in greater hatred, yet received afterward into Grace again. And it is ≈øtrange to read what Crimes this <hi>Hubert</hi> was
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56661:101"/>charged with at his Arraignment, and e≈øpecially one;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That to di≈ø≈øuade a great Lady from marrying with the King,</hi> he had ≈øaid, <hi>The King was a ≈øquint-eyed Fool, and a kind of Leper, deceitful, perjured, more faint-hearted than a Woman, and utterly unfit for any Ladies Company.</hi> For which, and other crimes laid to his charge in the Kings Bench, where the King him≈øelf was pre≈øent, he was adjudged to have his Lands Confi≈øcate, and to be deprived of his Title of Earl, yet after all, he was re≈øtored to his E≈øtate again, and ≈øuffered to live quiet.</p>
               <p>There is likewi≈øe an in≈øtance of his Timorou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in the following pa≈ø≈øage. The King being in his Barge on the <hi>Thames,</hi> on a ≈øudden the Air grew dark, and there followed a terrible Shower with Thunder and Lightning, of which the King being impatient, commanded him≈øelf to be put to Land at the next Stairs, which was <hi>Durham-hou≈øe,</hi> where <hi>Simon Montford</hi> Earl of <hi>Leice≈øter</hi> lived; which the Earl having notice of, came to wait on the King, ≈øaying, <hi>Sir, Why are you afraid, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe≈øt is now pa≈øt.</hi> Whereunto the King with a ≈øtern look, replied, <hi>I fear Thunder and Lightning ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, but by the head of God, I fear thee more than all the Thunder and Lightning in the World.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earl an≈øwered, <hi>My Leige it is injurious and incredible that you ≈øhould ≈øtand ≈øo much in fear of me, who have been always loyal both to you and your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; whereas you ought to fear your Enemies, even tho≈øe that de≈øtroy the Realm, and abu≈øe your Maje≈øty with bad Coun≈øels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Kings Reign the two great Charters of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>Charta de Fore≈øtae</hi> were rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and confirmed. The Pleas of the Crown were likewi≈øe pleaded in the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> All Wears in the <hi>Thames,</hi> were in this Kings time ordered to be pulled up and de≈øtroyed. Al≈øo the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56661:101"/>Citizens of <hi>London</hi> were allowed by Charter to pa≈øs Toll-free through <hi>England,</hi> and to have free liberty of Hunting about <hi>London:</hi> they had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe licence to have and u≈øe a Common Seal. It was al≈øo ordained that no Sheriff of <hi>London</hi> ≈øhould continue in his Office longer than one Year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>, whereas before they continued many; and the City were allowed to pre≈øent their Mayor to the Barons of the Exchequer to be ≈øworn, who before was pre≈øented to the King where-ever he were. In the 32 year of his Reign, the Wharf in <hi>London</hi> called <hi>Queen-Hith</hi> was farmed to the Citizens for fifty pounds a year: which is ≈øcarce now worth fifteen.</p>
               <p>This King cau≈øed a Che≈øt of Gold to be made for laying up the Reliques of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confe≈ø≈øor, in the Church of <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter. Hubert de Burgh</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> was buried in the Church of the Friars Preachers in <hi>London;</hi> to which Church he gave his Pallace at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> which afterward the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>York</hi> bought and made it his Inn, then commonly called <hi>York Place,</hi> and now <hi>Whitchall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the thirteenth year of this King, there were great Thunders and Lightnings, which burnt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hou≈øes, and ≈ølew both Men and Bea≈øts. In his 15. year, upon <hi>S. Pauls</hi> day, when <hi>Roger Wiger</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>London,</hi> was at Ma≈øs at <hi>S. Pauls,</hi> the Sky ≈øuddenly grew dark, and ≈øuch a terrible Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap ≈øell upon the Church, that it was ≈øhaken as if it would have fallen; and ≈øo great a fla≈øh of Lightning came out of a dark Cloud, that all the Church ≈øeemed to be on fire, ≈øo that all the people ran out of the Church and fell on the ground with a≈øtoni≈øhment. In 1233. five Suns were ≈øeen at one time together: after which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ≈øo great a Dearth, that people were forced to eat Hor≈øe-fle≈øh, and Barks of Trees: and in
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56661:102"/>
                  <hi>London</hi> twenty thou≈øand were ≈øtarved for want of Bread.</p>
               <p>In 1236. the River of <hi>Thames</hi> overflowed the Banks, ≈øo that in the great Pallace at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> men rowed with Boats in the mid≈øt of the Hall. In 1240. many ≈øtrange Fi≈øhes came a≈øhore, and among others forty Sea Bulls, and one of a huge bigne≈øs pa≈ø≈øed through <hi>London</hi> Bridge unhurt, till he came to the Kings Hou≈øe at <hi>Moreclack,</hi> where he was killed. In 1263. the <hi>Thames</hi> again over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Banks about <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and drowned Hou≈øes and Fields for the ≈øpace of ≈øix Miles. And the ≈øame Year there was a Blazing Star ≈øeen for three Moneths. In 1264. ≈øeven hundred <hi>Jews</hi> were ≈ølain in <hi>London,</hi> their Goods ≈øpoiled, and their Synagogue defaced, becau≈øe one <hi>Jew</hi> would have forced a Chri≈øtian to have paid above two pence a Week for the u≈øe of twenty ≈øhillings.</p>
               <p>In 1268. there happened a great quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Gold≈ømiths and Taylors of <hi>London,</hi> which occa≈øioned much mi≈øchief to be done, and many men were ≈ølain; for which Riot twelve of the Ringleaders were hanged. In 1269. the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Thames</hi> was ≈øo hard frozen from the la≈øt of <hi>November</hi> to <hi>Gandlemas,</hi> that men and Bea≈øts pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed over from <hi>Lambeth</hi> to <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> and Goods were brought from <hi>Sandwich</hi> and other Port Towns by Land. In 1271. the Steeple of <hi>Bow</hi> in <hi>Cheap≈øide</hi> fell down, and ≈ølew many people both Men and Women. About the ≈øame time a Child was born near <hi>London,</hi> who is reported at two years old to have cured all Di≈øea≈øes. And at <hi>Greenwich</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> a Lamb was yeaned which had two perfect bodies, and but one head.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the third died <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. 1272. when he had reigned 56 years and 28 days, and was buried at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> having built a great part of that Church. As ≈øoon as he was dead, the great
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56661:102"/>Lords of the Realm cau≈øed his elde≈øt Son Prince <hi>Edward</hi> (the fir≈øt of that name) to be proclaimed King; and a≈ø≈øembling at the <hi>New Temple</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> they there took order for the quiet Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Realm till he came; for he was at this time in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and had been there above a year when his Father died, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med many great Actions; after which, out of Envy to his valour, a de≈øperate <hi>Saracen,</hi> who had been often imployed to him from their General, being one time upon pretence of ≈øome ≈øecret Me≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øage admitted alone into his Chamber, gave him three wounds with a poi≈øoned knife, two in the Arm, and one near the Armpit, which were thought to be mortal, and perhaps had been ≈øo, if out of un≈øpeakable love, the Lady <hi>Eleanor</hi> his wife had not ≈øuckt out the poi≈øon of his wounds with her mouth, thereby effecting a Cure, which el≈øe had been incurable: and it is no wonder that Love ≈øhould do Wonders, ≈øince it is it ≈øelf a Wonder.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Edward</hi> heard of his Fathers death, he took it far more heavily, than he did that of his young Son <hi>Henry,</hi> of who≈øe death he had heard a little before, at which when <hi>Chartes</hi> King of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (where he then was) wondered, he an≈øwered, <hi>He might have more Sons, but he could never have another Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his return to <hi>London,</hi> he was crowned at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter, Augu≈øt</hi> 15. 1274. and ≈øoon after called a Parliament, wherein he would admit no Church-men to ≈øit, And a while after he makes War again≈øt <hi>Baliol</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> whom he takes pri≈øoner with the lo≈øs of twenty five thou≈øand <hi>Scots,</hi> and commits him pri≈øoner to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> He likewi≈øe brings from <hi>Scotland</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Chair wherein the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> u≈øed to be Crowned, which now ≈øeems to recover that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56661:103"/>≈øecret operation, according to the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øie, <hi>That whither≈øoever that Chair ≈øhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Kingdom ≈øhould be removed with it:</hi> and this Chair King <hi>Edward</hi> cau≈øed to be brought out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to be placed at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Monuments, where it ≈øtill continues.</p>
               <p>This King re≈øtored to the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> their Liberties, which for ≈øome mi≈ødemeanours they had forfeited. In the ≈øixteenth year of his Reign, the Sun was ≈øo exceeding hot, that many men died with the extremity thereof; and yet Wheat was ≈øold for three ≈øhillings four pence a Quarter at <hi>London.</hi> This King by Proclamation forbid the u≈øe of Sea-coal in <hi>London</hi> and the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs,</hi> for avoiding the noi≈øom Smoak. In his time the Bakers of <hi>London</hi> were fir≈øt drawn upon Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, by <hi>Henry Wallis</hi> Mayor, and Corn was then fir≈øt ≈øold by weight.</p>
               <p>In a Synod held in his time, it was Ordained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Con≈øtitution of the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>That no Eccle≈øia≈øtical per≈øon ≈øhall have more than one Benefice, with the Cure of Souls.</hi> About this time the new work of the Church at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter</hi> was fini≈øhed; and the Foundation of the <hi>Black-Fryars</hi> near <hi>Ludgate,</hi> was laid by <hi>Kilwarby</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to build the Quire of the <hi>Gray Friars</hi> in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> now called <hi>Chri≈øtchurch.</hi> In his time was begun to be made the great Conduit, formerly at the lower end of <hi>Cheap≈øide.</hi> And <hi>Henry Wall is</hi> Mayor, made the Tun in <hi>Cornhil</hi> a Pri≈øon for Nightwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, and likewi≈øe built a Hou≈øe at the <hi>Stocks Market</hi> for Fi≈øh and Fle≈øh, which ≈øince the fatal Fire in 1666. is demoli≈øhed and laid into the Street.</p>
               <p>In the ninth year of his Reign, there was ≈øuch a great Fro≈øt, that five Arches of <hi>London</hi> Bridge, and all <hi>Roche≈øter</hi> Bridge was carried down, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56661:103"/>born away. On St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> day in the Even, were great Earthquakes, Lightning, and Thunder, with a great Dragon, and a Blazing Star, which extremely terrified the People. In his two and twentieth year, three men had their right hands cut off for re≈øcuing a Pri≈øoner from an Officer of the City of <hi>London:</hi> and about that time the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Thames</hi> overflowing the Banks, made a breach at <hi>Redriff</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> and the lower Grounds thereabout were all laid under Water. In his twenty ≈øeventh year, a Fire being kindled in the le≈ø≈øer Hall of the Pallace of <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> the flame thereof being driven by the wind, fired the Mona≈øtery next adjoyning: which with the Pallace were both con≈øumed. The ≈øame year by an Act of Common Council in <hi>London,</hi> with the Kings con≈øent, it was Ordained, that a fat Cock ≈øhould be ≈øold for three half pence, two Pallets for three half pence, a fat Capon for two pence half penny, a Goo≈øe for four pence, a Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard three half pence, a Partridge three half pence, a Phea≈øant four pence, a Heron ≈øix pence, a Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one penny, a Swan three ≈øhillings, a Crane twelve pence, two Woodcocks three half pence, a fat Lamb from Chri≈øtmas to Shrovetide ≈øixteen pence, and all the year after for four pence; and Wheat was this year ≈øo plentiful, that a Quarter was ≈øold for ten Groats.</p>
               <p>In his thirty ≈øecond year <hi>William Wallace,</hi> who had often cau≈øed great trouble in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was taken and hanged, beheaded, and quartered in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After King <hi>Edward</hi> had reigned thirty four years and ≈øeven moneths, he died, and was buried at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> leaving his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the ≈øecond, called <hi>Carnarvan</hi> to ≈øucceed him: Of whom the People had at fir≈øt great expectation, but he ≈øoon brake all his Fathers admonitions, e≈øpecially that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56661:104"/>he ≈øhould bani≈øh for ever <hi>Pierce Gave≈øton,</hi> who had been his Companion in many Irregularities in his Youth. He married <hi>I≈øabel,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair, of <hi>France,</hi> and makes <hi>Gave≈øton</hi> his chiefe≈øt Favourite; which ≈øo incen≈øed the Lords, that they threaten, unle≈øs he would bani≈øh him his Court and Kingdom, they would hinder his Coronation. Which he promi≈øes to do, but doth not perform; but on the contrary, be≈øtows ≈øo much of his Trea≈øury upon him, that he ≈øcarce left means to ≈øu≈øtain him≈øelf, or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Queen.</p>
               <p>This put the Lords into a new di≈øcontent, who thereupon went again to the King, and told him plainly, <hi>That unle≈øs he would put</hi> Gave≈øton <hi>out of the Court and Kingdom, they would ri≈øe up in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him as a perjured King.</hi> Whereupon out of fear, the King ≈øends him to <hi>France,</hi> where finding no entertainment more than in other places, he ≈øoon returns again, and is received into as much favour as before. Whereupon the whole Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity join together (except <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi>) and rai≈øing Forces ≈øend to the King, either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>Gave≈øton</hi> into their hands, or el≈øe to bani≈øh him immediately out of the kingdom. But the King, led by evil Coun≈øel, ≈øtill refu≈øed. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lords hearing where he was, ≈øeized him, and cut off his head.</p>
               <p>The King being much concerned at his death, to vex the Nobility, takes into his neare≈øt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity and Council, the two <hi>Spencers,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Father, and Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> the Son, men as debaucht and odious to the Lords and the People, as the other was; for they inclined the King to a lewd and wanton cour≈øe of life among Whores and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, and to for≈øake the company of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt and vertuous Queen, which made him a Scorn to Foreign Princes, and hateful in the ≈øight
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56661:104"/>of all hone≈øt men; yet the King, in de≈øpight of his Lords, ≈øupported the <hi>Spencers</hi> in whatever they did. Whereupon the Lords ri≈øe in Arms, and the King likewi≈øe rai≈øeth Forces, where a great Battle was fought, and the Barons were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and after the Fight, two and twenty of the Lords were beheaded: which increa≈øed the pride and in≈øolence of the <hi>Spencers.</hi>

               <p>Not long after, this King was murthered by Sir <hi>John Matravers</hi> and <hi>Thomas Gourney,</hi> by thru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hot Spit up his Fundament into his Bowels, after he had reigned nineteen Years and 6 months. 1327. In the eighth year of his reign, was ≈øo great a Dearth, that Hor≈øes and Dogs were eaten, and Thieves in Pri≈øon pulled in pieces, tho≈øe that were newly brought in among≈øt them, and eat them half alive. Which continuing three years, in the end brought ≈øuch a Pe≈øtilence, that the living ≈øcarce ≈øufficed to bury the dead. In this Kings time, digging the Foundation of a Work about St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> were found above an hundred Heads of Oxen and Kine, which confirmed the opinions, that of old time it had been the Temple of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and that there was the Sacrifice of Bea≈øts.</p>

                  <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> elde≈øt Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ≈øecond, by the order of Parliament upon his Fathers Re≈øignation, was proclaimed King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Jan.</hi> 25. 1327. and ≈øoon after a Parliament was called, wherein <hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> the Kings Uncle, is accu≈øed for intending to re≈øtore his Brother; upon which he was condemned, and brought to the Scaffold, but was ≈øo generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the People, that he ≈øtood there from one of the Clock till five in the Afternoon, before any Executioner could be found to do the Office, till at la≈øt a ≈øilly Wretch in the Mar≈øhal≈øey was gotten to cut off his head. But the authors of his death e≈øcaped not long them≈øelves: for in the third year of the Kings Reign, another Parliament is holden,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56661:105"/>wherein the Queen hath all her great Jointure taken from her, and is put to her Pen≈øion of a thou≈øand pound a Year, and her ≈øelf confined to a Ca≈øtle, where ≈øhe remained the re≈øt of her days, no fewer than thirty years. Time long enough to convince her, that her being the daughter of a King, the wife of a King, and the mother of a King, were glorious Titles, but all not worth the Liberty of a mean E≈øtate.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> her great Minion and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, lately created Earl of the Marches of <hi>Wales,</hi> was ≈øeized on this manner. The King ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others with him, went ≈øecretly one night by Torch-light, through a private way under ground, till they came to the Queens chamber, where lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the King without, ≈øome of them went in, and found the Queen with <hi>Mortimer</hi> ready to go to bed; and laying hands on him, they brought him out, after whom the Queen followed, crying, <hi>Good Son, good Son, take pity upon the gentle</hi> Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ≈øu≈øpecting her Son had been among≈øt them. This way was taken to apprehend him, to prevent Tumult, he having no le≈øs than nine≈øcore Knights and Gentlemen, be≈øides other meaner Servants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him continually. Being thus ≈øeized, he is committed to the Tower, and accu≈øed of divers crimes, and among≈øt the re≈øt, that he had been too familiar with the Queen, by whom ≈øhe was thought to be with child. Of which Articles he was found guilty, and condemned, and thereupon is drawn and hanged at the common Gallows at the <hi>Elms,</hi> now called <hi>Tyburn,</hi> where his body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained two days an opprobrious ≈øpectacle to all beholders.</p>
               <p>This King <hi>Edward</hi> the third was a victorious Prince, and with the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of his Son <hi>Edward,</hi> called the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> won many con≈øiderable Victories again≈øt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scetch,</hi> taking

               <p>In the fourth year of his Reign the Sea Banks were overflown through all <hi>England,</hi> but e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the River <hi>Thames,</hi> ≈øo that all the Cattle and Bea≈øts near thereunto were drowned. There was likewi≈øe found a Serpent having two heads, and two faces like a Woman, one face dre≈øt after the new fa≈øhion, and another like the old, with Wings like a Bat, and men and women peri≈øhed in divers places by Lightning and Thunder; Fiends, Devils, and Apparitions were likewi≈øe ≈øeen by men, and ≈øpoke to them as they travelled. At this time upon the Petition of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> an Act was made that no common Whore ≈øhould wear any Hood, except ≈øtriped with divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, nor Furs, but Garments turned the wrong ≈øide outward. This King confirmed the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and ordained that the L.

Likewi≈øe that <hi>Southwark</hi> ≈øhould be under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City, and the Lord Mayor to chu≈øe a Bailiff there as he plea≈øed.

               </p>
               <p>It was wonderful how calm the Prince was in his own cau≈øe, who had been ≈øo violent in his Companions: for he pariently obeyed the Judges Sentence and ≈øuffered him≈øelf quietly to be led to Pri≈øon. This pa≈ø≈øage was very plea≈øing to the King his Father, to think he had a Judge of ≈øuch courage, and a Son of ≈øuch ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion. But yet for the≈øe and ≈øome other Frolicks, the King di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed him from being Pre≈øident of the Council, and placed therein his third Son <hi>John.</hi> This made the Prince ≈øo ≈øen≈øible of his Fathers di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure, that he endeavoured to recover his good opinion, by as ≈øtrange a way as he lo≈øt it: for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring him≈øelf in a Garment of blue Sattin, wrought all with Oylet holes of black Silk, the Needle hanging thereto, and about his Arm a thing like a Dogs Collar, ≈øtudded with SS of Gold, he came to the Court at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> to whom the King, though not well in health, cau≈øed him≈øelf to be brought in a Chair into his Privy Chamber, where in the pre≈øence of three or four onely of his Privy Council, he demanded of the Prince the cau≈øe of his unwonted Habit and coming; who an≈øwered, <hi>That being not onely his Subject, but his Son, and a Son always ≈øo tenderly beloved by him, he were worthy of a thou≈øand deaths, if he ≈øhould but intend or imagine the lea≈øt offence to his Maje≈øty, and had therefore prepared him≈øelf to be made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi> and thereupon reached his Digger, and holding it by the point he ≈øaid; <hi>Sir, I de≈øire not to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56661:110"/>live longer then that I may be thought to be what I am, and ≈øhall ever be, Your faithful and obedient Va≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this or the like an≈øwer, the King was ≈øo moved, that he fell upon his Sons neck, and with many tears imbracing him, confe≈ø≈øed, <hi>That his ears had been too open to receive Reports again≈øt him, and promi≈øing faithfully, that from thenceforth no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ≈øhould cau≈øe any di≈øaffection toward him.</hi> But as ≈øoon as this young King was Crowned at <hi>We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min≈øter</hi> he like king <hi>Saul</hi> ≈øeemed to have a new heart given him, and became another man than he was before. For calling his old Companions and brethren in evil before him, he ≈øtrictly charged them not to come within Ten miles of the Court till they had given proof of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, And to prevent their proceding in ill cour≈øes, he gave every one of them a ≈øufficient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
               <p>Immediately after a Parliament was called at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter,</hi> where a Sub≈øidy was granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking, and the Commons began to harp up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the old ≈øtring of taking away the Lands of the Clergy, which the Bi≈øhops, fearing the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, endeavoured to divert, by ≈øhewing him the great Right he had to the Crown of <hi>France:</hi> which they made ≈øo plainly appear, that he alters his Arms, and quarters the <hi>Flower de Luces</hi> like the King of <hi>France;</hi> But to do it fairly, he ≈øends Amba≈ø≈øadors <hi>to Charles</hi> the ≈øixth King of <hi>France,</hi> Requiring him in a Peacable manner to ≈øurrender the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> The Amba≈ø≈øadors had five hundred Hor≈øe to attend them, and were at fir≈øt honourably received and Treated by the Court of <hi>France;</hi> but when their Me≈ø≈øage was known their Entertainment was ≈øoon altered and the <hi>Dauphin</hi> (who managed the Affairs of State during the Kings ≈øickne≈øs) about this time ≈øent a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56661:110"/>Tun of Tennis Balls to K. <hi>Henry</hi> in deri≈øion of his Youth, as fitter to play with them than to manage Arms. Which King <hi>Henry</hi> took in ≈øuch ≈øcorn, that he promi≈øed with an Oath, <hi>It ≈øhould not be long before he would to≈øs ≈øuch iron Balls among them, that the be≈øt Arms of</hi> France <hi>≈øhould not be able to hold a Racket to return them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And accordingly he went with an Army into <hi>France,</hi> and utterly routed the <hi>French</hi> Army at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gincourt,</hi> though they were 6 times as many as the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> killing about nine thou≈øand of them, and taking fifteen hundred pri≈øoners; and on the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> part not above ≈øix hundred were ≈ølain in all.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of his Reign, the followers of <hi>Wickliff</hi> greatly encrea≈øed, of whom Sir <hi>John Old-Ca≈øtle</hi> was chief, who by marriage came to be Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and in great favour with the King. But being accu≈øed in a Synod of <hi>London</hi> for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <hi>Wickliffs</hi> Doctrine, the King ≈øent for him, and per≈øuaded him to ≈øubmit to the cen≈øure of the Church; who told the King he onely owed ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Maje≈øty, and for others, he would ≈øtand for the Truth again≈øt them with his life. Upon which he was cited to appear in the Bi≈øhops Court, which he refu≈øing was condemned by a Synod for an Heretick; in which Synod the Arch-Bi≈øhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> cau≈øed it to be ordained, <hi>That the Holy Scriptures ought not to be tran≈ølated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the</hi> Engli≈øh Tongue. But mark the Judgment of God that fell upon his own Tongue, who≈øe roots and blade ≈øhortly after (as it is recorded) grew ≈øo big in his mouth and throat, that he could neither ≈øpeak nor ≈øwallow down meat, but in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour lay langui≈øhing, till at la≈øt ≈øtarved by Famine, ≈øo died.</p>
               <p>After this Sir <hi>John Oldca≈øtle</hi> was taken, and he, Sir <hi>Roger Acton,</hi> and twenty eight more, were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56661:111"/>at S. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields, and in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> for Here≈øie: and all the Pri≈øons in and about <hi>London,</hi> were filled with his Followers.</p>
               <p>In the third year of this Kings Reign, on <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlemas</hi> day, ≈øeven Dolphins came up the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> whereof four were taken. This King had ≈øuch command in <hi>France,</hi> that their own Chronicles te≈øtifie in the Court of Chancery in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> all things were ≈øealed with the Seal of King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> In the ≈øecond year of his Reign, <hi>Moregate</hi> near <hi>Coleman≈øtreet</hi> was fir≈øt made by <hi>Thomas Fawkener</hi> Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> who cau≈øed the Water of this City to be turned into the <hi>Thames</hi> in <hi>Walbrook,</hi> by making Grates in divers places.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth died the thirty fifth year of his age, and the ninth of his Reign, leaving his Son <hi>Henry</hi> to enjoy his Crown, who was but eight months old when his Father died, yet by the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Regent of <hi>France,</hi> is proclaimed King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and at nine years old was crowned King there, receiving the Oaths and Fealty of all the <hi>French</hi> Nobility.</p>
               <p>This King was very weak in Judgment, and was ruled onely by his Queen, which occa≈øioned him very great trouble: for they u≈øed his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the de≈øtruction of the Duke of <hi>Gloce≈øter,</hi> and ≈øeveral other per≈øons, who were much belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the People. About which time the Duke of <hi>York</hi> began to whi≈øper his Right to the Crown, as de≈øcended from <hi>Philippa,</hi> Daughter and Heir to <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> Elder Brother to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> and Great Grandfather to the pre≈øent King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øixth, and it was privately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcour≈øed, <hi>That King</hi> Henry <hi>was of a weak capacity, and ea≈øily abu≈øed, and the Queen, who was near to the</hi> French <hi>Queen, was of a malignant ≈øpirit, and bloudily ambitious, the Privy Council is wi≈øe enough,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56661:111"/>yet not hone≈øt enough, regarding more their own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profit than the publick good, and that through their neglect, all</hi> France <hi>was lo≈øt, and that God would not ble≈øs the u≈øurped Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of King</hi> Henry. With the≈øe ≈øugge≈øtions the <hi>Kenti≈øh</hi> men ≈øeemed to be taken; which being ob≈øerved by an In≈øtrument of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> one <hi>Mortimer,</hi> he takes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to tell the People, <hi>That if they will be ruled by him, he will ≈øhew them the way to make a thorough Reformation, and prevent the Taxes that are upon every ≈ølight occa≈øion laid upon them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The≈øe promi≈øes of Reformation and Freedom, ≈øo wrought with the People, that they drew to a Head, and make <hi>Mortimer,</hi> otherwi≈øe called <hi>Jack Cade,</hi> their Leader, who ≈øtiled him≈øelf Captain <hi>Mendall:</hi> with whom they came to <hi>Black-heath,</hi> and lay thereabout a Moneth, ≈øending for whom, and what he plea≈øed. He then pre≈øents the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Commons to the Parliament, who ≈øent them to the Privy Council; but they explode them as frivolous, and charge the Authors to be pre≈øumptuous Rebels: and thereupon the King rai≈øeth an Army, and brings them to <hi>Greenwich;</hi> but the Lords could get no Followers to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them, who fought onely for Reformation of Abu≈øes, and for puni≈øhment of ≈øuch Traitors as they ≈øaid the Lord <hi>Say</hi> was. The Lord <hi>Say</hi> is hereupon committed to the Tower, and the King and Queen retire to <hi>London,</hi> whom <hi>Cade</hi> follows, and comes to <hi>Southwark,</hi> where he Quarters his men; and next morning marcheth to <hi>London</hi> Bridge, where he cau≈øed his Followers to cut the Rope of the Draw-bridge, no re≈øi≈øtance being made again≈øt him, and ≈øo in good order marched up to <hi>London-Stone,</hi> upon which he ≈øtrook his Sword, ≈øaying, <hi>Now is</hi> Mortimer <hi>Lord of</hi> London. He then ≈øent for the Lord <hi>Say</hi> out of the Tower, and cut off his head at the Standard in <hi>Cheap≈øide,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56661:112"/>and al≈øo the head of Sir <hi>James Cromer</hi> High-Sheriff of <hi>Kent;</hi> but upon the Kings General Pardon, his Followers leave him, and he is ≈øoon after ≈ølain, and with the execution of eight more, though five hundred were found guilty, this In≈øurrection is ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed.</p>
               <p>It was a cu≈øtom that upon St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> day the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> ≈øhould go to the Wre≈øtling-place near <hi>More-fields,</hi> where at this time the Prior of St. <hi>Johns</hi> likewi≈øe was to ≈øee the ≈øport; and a Servant of his being a≈øhamed to be foiled before his Ma≈øter, de≈øired to Wre≈øtle again, contrary to cu≈øtom, which the Lord Mayor denied: whereupon the Prior fetched Bowmen from <hi>Clerkenwel</hi> again≈øt the Mayor, and ≈øome ≈ølaughter was made; the Mayors Cap was ≈øhot through with an Arrow, yet he would have the ≈øport go on, but no Wre≈øtlers came: whereupon he ≈øaid, <hi>He would ≈øtay a while to make Trial of the Citizens re≈øpect to him;</hi> and pre≈øently after a great party of them came with Banners di≈øplaid, and fetched him home in triumph. Soon after another Quarrel happened in <hi>Holborn</hi> between the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the <hi>Inns of Chancery,</hi> and ≈øome Citizens, in appea≈øing whereof, the Queens Attorney and three more were ≈ølain. The year after the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices of <hi>London,</hi> upon a very ≈ølight occa≈øion fall upon the Foreign Merchants, rifling and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing their hou≈øes, but the Lord Mayor by his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion appea≈øed the Tumult, puni≈øhing ≈øome of the Offenders with Death, and others by Fine, and all things are quieted and appea≈øed.</p>

               <p>As ≈øoon as this Parliament was di≈ø≈øolved, the Duke ≈øends for the Queen and ≈øome others, to come out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> But they had rai≈øed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there, and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> met them with another; and at <hi>Wakefield Green</hi> the Duke is flain, with the lo≈øs of three thou≈øand of his men, and leing dead, had his head crowned with a Paper Crown, together with many other Circum≈øtances
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56661:114"/>of di≈øgrace. However his Son <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> pro≈øecutes the Quarrel, and puts the Queens Forces to flight, which ≈øhe endeavoured to recruit; but ≈øome of her Northern Army ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving robbed the People as they came along the Country, ≈øaying, <hi>It was their Bargain to have all the Spoil in every place.</hi> The <hi>Londoners</hi> would not ≈øuffer any Provi≈øion to be ≈øent to them, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ri≈øing about <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> and ≈øtopping the Carts which the Lord Mayor was ≈øending to the Army.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Earls of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> having got a con≈øiderable Army, march to <hi>London,</hi> and were joyfully received there. And ≈øoon after the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> drawing all his Forces into St. <hi>Johns</hi> Field by <hi>Clerkenwel,</hi> and having ca≈øt them in a Ring, he read to them the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the la≈øt Parliament, and then demanded, <hi>Whether they would have King</hi> Henry <hi>to reign ≈øtill?</hi> Who all cryed out, <hi>No, No.</hi> Then he asked them, <hi>Whether they would have the Earl of</hi> March, <hi>Elde≈øt Son of the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>(by that Parliament pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King) to reign over them.</hi> Who with great ≈øhouting an≈øwered, <hi>Yes, Yes.</hi> Then ≈øeveral Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and others of the City, went to the Earl of <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Baynards</hi> Ca≈øtle, to acquaint him what had pa≈ø≈øed; who at fir≈øt ≈øeemed to excu≈øe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, as unable to execute ≈øo great a charge: but encouraged by the Archbi≈øhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Exeter,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> he at laft con≈øented to take it upon him; and ≈øoon after he was generally proclaimed King. And here Writers end the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øixth, though there were ≈øeveral changes. For ≈øometimes he was a King, and ≈øometimes none, yet he was never well ≈øetled, though he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved twelve years after.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> was then in the North, and rai≈øe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56661:114"/>an Army to oppo≈øe <hi>Edward,</hi> but is defeated by the Lord <hi>Falconbridge.</hi> Upon which <hi>Henry</hi> and his Queen go to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and rai≈øe more Forces, but are again beaten.

And the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> is ≈øent into <hi>France</hi> to treat of a Marriage with that Kings daughter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap> but in the mean while the King marries the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Gray.</hi> At which <hi>Warwick</hi> grows di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and joins again≈øt King <hi>Edward,</hi> and ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing him, takes him Pri≈øoner, but he ≈øoon made his e≈øcape. King <hi>Henry</hi> was taken in di≈øgui≈øe and ≈øent to the Tower of <hi>London</hi> ≈øome years before. And now <hi>Warwick</hi> going to <hi>France,</hi> brought a great Army over, and proclaimed <hi>Edward</hi> an U≈øurper; who thereupon endeavoured to rai≈øe an Army but could not, and therefore fled out of <hi>England</hi> into the Duke of <hi>Burgundies</hi> Country, and King <hi>Henry</hi> is taken out of Pri≈øon, where he had been nine years, and again proclaimed King.</p>
               <p>But King <hi>Edward,</hi> by the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> lands an Army in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and marches towards <hi>London,</hi> where he was joyfully received. And in the year 1471, and the 11 year of his Reign, K. <hi>Edward</hi> made his entry into the City, and had King <hi>Henry</hi> delivered into his hands. The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> having notice thereof, marcheth with his Army toward St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi> follows him, carrying King <hi>Henry</hi> along with him; where the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> and many others are ≈ølain, and <hi>Henries</hi> Parry utterly routed.</p>
               <p>And now was the time for King <hi>Henry</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of all his Troubles; for the bloudy Duke of <hi>Gloce≈øter</hi> entering the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> where he ≈øound King <hi>Henry</hi> nothing at all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56661:115"/>for all his Cro≈ø≈øes, ≈øtruck him into the heart with his Dagger, and there ≈ølew him. And now within half a years ≈øpace, we find one Parliament proclaimed <hi>Edward</hi> an U≈øurper, and <hi>Henry</hi> a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful King; and another proclaiming <hi>Edward</hi> a lawful King, and <hi>Henry</hi> an U≈øurper; that we may know there is nothing certain in humane Affairs, but uncertainty.</p>
               <p>In the fifth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øixth, it rained almo≈øt continually from <hi>Ea≈øter</hi> to <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi> In his ≈øeventh year the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> was like to have been drowned pa≈ø≈øing through <hi>London</hi> Bridge, his Barge being ≈øet upon the Piles ≈øo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, that thirty per≈øons were drowned, and the Duke with others that e≈øcaped, were fain to be drawn up with Ropes. In his ≈øeventeenth year was ≈øo great a Dearth of Corn, that people were glad to make Bread of Fearn roots. Next year all the Lions in the Tower died. In the thirty third year of his Reign, there was a great Blazing Star, and there happened a ≈øtrange ≈øight, a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrous Cock came out of the Sea, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of a multitude of people, made a hideous crowing three times, beckening toward the North, South, and We≈øt. There were al≈øo many prodigious Births, and in ≈øome places it rained bloud.</p>
               <p>About this time the Draw-bridge on <hi>London</hi> Bridge was made, and <hi>Leaden Hall</hi> was built to be a Storehou≈øe of Grain and Fewel for the poor of the City. In the fir≈øt year of this Kings Reign a Parliament was held at <hi>London,</hi> where the Queen-Mother, with the young King in her lap, came and ≈øate in the Hou≈øe of Lords. In this Kings Reign Printing was fir≈øt brought into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> by <hi>William Caxton</hi> of <hi>London</hi> Mercer, who fir≈øt practi≈øed the ≈øame in the Abby of <hi>We≈øtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtor</hi> 1471.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56661:115"/>when he had reigned thirty eight years ≈øix months and odd days.

               </p>
               <p>In the fir≈øt year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth <hi>Walter Walker</hi> Grocer, living in <hi>Cheap≈øide,</hi> was beheaded for ≈øpeaking ≈øome words again≈øt King <hi>Edward.</hi> In his fourth year there was a great Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtilence, and the Thames was frozen over. In his 14 year <hi>John Gro≈øe</hi> was burnt on <hi>Tower-hill</hi> for Religion. The ≈øame year King <hi>Edward</hi> in his Progre≈øs hunting in Sir <hi>Thomas Burdels</hi> Park, ≈ølew many Deer, and among the re≈øt a white Buck, which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hearing of, wi≈øhed <hi>the Bucks head, horns and all in his belly who moved the King to kill him.</hi> Upon which words he was condemned to die, and being drawn from the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> was there beheaded. Next year <hi>George</hi> D. of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> K. <hi>Ed.</hi> Brother, was drowned in the Tower in a But of Malm≈øey.

But the≈øe Murderers came all to mi≈øerable ends; and King <hi>Richard</hi> him≈øelf, after this abominable Fact, never had a quiet mind, but was troubled with fearful dreams, and would ≈øometimes ≈øtart out of his bed and run about the chamber in a great fright, as if all the Furies in Hell were about him, as he did the night before the Battle at <hi>Bo≈øworth</hi> Field, where he was ≈ølain by King <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, who ≈øucceeded to the Crown.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Richard</hi> took away from <hi>Jane Shore</hi> one of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Concubines, all her Goods, to the value of above 3000 Marks; and afterward cau≈øed her to do Pennance before the Cro≈øs for her Incontinency, with a Taper in her hand: when, though undre≈ø≈øed, yet ≈øhe appeared ≈øo fair, and lovely, and likewi≈øe ≈øo mode≈øt, that many who hated her cour≈øe of life, yet pitied her cour≈øe u≈øage, ≈øince ≈øhe u≈øed all the favour ≈øhe had with King <hi>Edward</hi> to the good of many, but never to the hurt of any.

The≈øe men were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and <hi>Hacket</hi> was arraigned, and found guilty of ≈øpeaking divers fal≈øe and traiterous words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the Queen, and to have raced and defaced her Pictures, thru≈øting an iron In≈øtrument into the place of the heart and bre≈øt; for which he was brought from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Cheap≈øide,</hi> and being moved to ask God and their Queen forgivene≈øs, he fell to cur≈øing and railing again≈øt the Queen, and made a bla≈øphemous Prayer again≈øt the divine Maje≈øty of God, and was therefore hanged and quartered. <hi>Coppinger</hi> ≈øtarved him≈øelf wilfully in <hi>Bridewel,</hi> and <hi>Arthington</hi> made a Recantation.</p>
               <p>In the forty third year of her Reign <hi>Robert De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereux</hi> Earl of <hi>E≈ø≈øex,</hi> a≈ø≈øi≈øted by divers Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Gentlemen, entered the City of <hi>London</hi> in Warlike manner at <hi>Temple Bar,</hi> crying <hi>For the Queen,</hi> till they came to the Sheriffs Hou≈øe in <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church-≈øtreet,</hi> who finding him≈øelf not Ma≈øter of his own hou≈øe, e≈øcaped out at a Back-door, and went to the Lord Mayor. And <hi>E≈ø≈øex</hi> finding the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56661:120"/>Citizens in Arms again≈øt him, endeavoured to fortifie his own Hou≈øe: but hearing that ≈øome great Guns were ≈øent for to beat it down, he ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred him≈øelf, and was ≈øent to the Tower, where he was afterward beheaded; but might have kept his head longer on, had he not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by the Lady <hi>Wal≈øingham;</hi> to whom after his condemnation he ≈øent a Ring, which the Queen had given him in token that ≈øhe would ≈øtand by him in any danger: the Lady delivered not this Ring, but being a little after upon her Death-bed, ≈øhe de≈øired to ≈øpeak with the Queen, to whom having disburthened her con≈øcience, the Queen flung away in extream rage and fury, and never enjoyed her ≈øelf well after that time, but would often break out into a pa≈ø≈øion, and wring her hands, crying, <hi>O E≈ø≈øex, E≈ø≈øex,</hi> and died not long after.</p>
               <p>After her death King <hi>James</hi> ≈øucceeded, in the third year of who≈øe Reign, was contrived the Powder Trea≈øon Plot, for which Sir <hi>Edward Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, Robert Winter, Graunt,</hi> and <hi>Bates</hi> were drawn, hanged, and quartered at the We≈øt end of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and <hi>Winter, Keys, Rookwood,</hi> and <hi>Fawks,</hi> at the Parliament Yard at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter.</hi> A while after, the King attended with divers Lords, dined with the Lord Mayor Sir <hi>John Watts,</hi> who after dinner pre≈øented his Maje≈øty with a Pur≈øe of Gold, de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring he would plea≈øe to be made Free of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Clothworkers,</hi> to which the King con≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and calling to the Ma≈øter of the Company, he ≈øaid, Stone, <hi>Give me thy hand, I am now a Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker, and in token of my ≈øpecial favour to this Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, I do here give to this Company a Brace of Bueks yearly for ever, at the Election of Ma≈øter and Wardens.</hi> And a Moneth after the King and the Prince dined at <hi>Merchant Taylors</hi> Hall, where the Prince was made Free of that Company, and had
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56661:120"/>likewi≈øe a Pur≈øe of Gold pre≈øented him by the Ma≈øter.</p>
               <p>In 1609. the <hi>New Exchange</hi> being newly fini≈øhed, was fir≈øt opened and named by King <hi>James, Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Bur≈øe.</hi> In 1612. <hi>Edward Wightman</hi> was burnt for an Heretick, and one <hi>Legat</hi> burnt in <hi>Smithfield</hi> for an <hi>Arian.</hi> In 1615. Sir <hi>Thomas Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> was poi≈øoned in the Tower, for which the the Earl of <hi>Somer≈øet</hi> and his Lady were arraigned and condemned, and Sir <hi>Gerva≈øe Elvis</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower, Mi≈øtris <hi>Turner,</hi> and divers others executed. In 1618. the famous Sir <hi>Walter Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh</hi> was beheaded in the <hi>New Pallace</hi> Yard <hi>We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min≈øter.</hi> Next year Queen <hi>Anne</hi> died at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> In 1623. a Popi≈øh Prie≈øt being at Ma≈øs in Black Fryars in an Upper Room, it fell down, and many were killed and hurt. In 1625. King <hi>James</hi> died, having reigned 22. years.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> his Son ≈øucceeded him, and was married to <hi>Henrietta Maria</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> In his fir≈øt year was a great Plague, whereof there died in <hi>London</hi> 35417. In 1628. Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the ≈øtreets of <hi>London,</hi> for which the City was fined ≈øix thou≈øand pound; the ≈øame year <hi>John Felton</hi> was hanged at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for murdering the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> In 1633. the King and Queen were magnificently entertained at <hi>Guild-hall.</hi> In 1640 the Long Parliament began, and in 1642. Po≈øts and Chains were ordered to be ≈øet up in the City.</p>
